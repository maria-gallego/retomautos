<p>If you’ve built simple websites using HTML, you’ll quickly progress to
building websites with Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or, if you have experience in a language
such as PHP or Java, you’ll make the jump to the Rails framework.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But
I promise you don’t need to be a programmer to succeed with this book or the next.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll be surprised how quickly you become familiar with the Unix command line interface and the Ruby programming language even if you’ve never tried programming before.</p>
<p>My books are ideal if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a student
</li>
<li>a startup founder
</li>
<li>making a career change
</li></ul>
<p>If you are starting a business, and hiring developers,
or working alongside developers as a manager or developer, this book
will help you talk with developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, the true purpose of my book is to help you become you a Rails
developer yourself.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I want to help you launch a startup or begin a new career.</p>
</div>

<p>Book One is a self-help book that can change your life,
though here you won’t find any inspirational quotes or magical thinking.</p>
<p>I explain the culture and practices of the Rails
community.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I introduce the basic concepts you’ll need to understand
web application development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll learn how to be a successful learner
and how to get help when you need it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I also provide a plan for study so you can learn more when you need it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s so much to learn,
it helps to have a map so you know where to go next.</p>
<p>Programming can be frustrating and Rails isn’t easy for beginners.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The chapter, “Rails Challenges,”
describes many of the problems learners encounter.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s natural to get discouraged so take a look when you begin to feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Two chapters, “Crossing the Chasm”, and “Level Up”, will help you after you put the book down.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Many learners feel stranded if their only experience is step-by-step tutorials.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These chapters are designed to give you a strategy for building an application on your own.</p>

<p>The best way to learn is by doing; when it comes to code, that means
building applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Hands-on learning with actual Rails
applications is the key to absorbing and retaining knowledge.</p>
<p>After you read this book, you’ll be able to work with the example applications from the <a href="https://railsapps.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RailsApps Project</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The project provides open source
example applications for Rails developers, for free.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each application is
accompanied by a tutorial in the Capstone Rails Tutorials
series, so there’s no mystery code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each application can be generated in a few minutes
with the <a href="https://www.railscomposer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails Composer</a> tool, which professional
developers use to create starter applications.</p>
<p>The RailsApps Project is solely supported by sales of the books, videos, and advanced tutorials.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you make a purchase, you’ll keep the project going.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And you’ll have my sincere appreciation for your support.</p>

<p>This book approaches the subject differently than most introductions to
Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It introduces concepts of product planning, project management,
and website analytics to place development within a larger context of
product development and marketing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In Book Two, rather than
show the student how to use scaffolding, I introduce the
model-view-controller design pattern by creating the components
manually.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Lastly, though every other Rails tutorial shows how to use a
database, Book Two doesn’t, because I want the book to be a short
introduction and I believe the basic principles of a web application
stand out more clearly without adding a database to the application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Though this tutorial is not a typical Rails introduction, I hope you’ll
agree that it does a good job in preparing Rails beginners for continued
study, whether it is a course or more advanced books.</p>

<p>This chapter provides the background, or big picture, you will need to
understand Rails.</p>
<p>These are the key concepts you’ll need to know before you try to use
Rails.</p>
<p>In the following two chapters, you’ll gain a deeper
understanding of Rails, including its history, the guiding principles
of Rails, and reasons for its popularity.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First, let’s consider how the web works.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid9" data-tralics-id="cid9" class="section" data-number="3.1"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid9" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">3.1 </span>How the Web Works</a></h2>
<p>We start with absolute basics, as promised.</p>
<p>When you “visit a website on the Internet” you use a <em>web browser</em> such
as Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Web browsers are <em>applications</em> (software programs) that work by reading
<em>files</em>.</p>
<p>Compare a <em>word processing program</em> with a <em>web browser</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Both word
processing programs and web browsers read files.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Microsoft Word reads
files that are stored on your computer to display documents.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A web
browser retrieves files from remote computers called <em>servers</em> to
display web pages.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Simply put, the World Wide Web is nothing more than files
delivered to web browsers by web servers.</p>
<p>Web browsers make <em>requests</em> to web servers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Every web address, or <em>URL</em>, is a request to a web server.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A web server <em>responds</em> by sending one or more files.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We call this the <em>request-response cycle</em>.</p>
<p>Everything displayed by a web browser comes from four kinds of files:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML - <em>structure</em> (layout) and <em>content</em> (text)
</li>
<li>CSS - <em>stylesheets</em> to set visual appearance
</li>
<li>JavaScript - <em>programming</em> to alter the page
</li>
<li>Multimedia - images, video, or other media files
</li></ul>
<p>At a minimum, a web page requires an HTML file.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> HTML files contain the words you see on a web page, along with <em>markup tags</em>
that indicate headlines, paragraphs, and other types of text such as lists.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If a web browser
receives only an HTML file, it will display text, with default styles
for headlines and paragraphs supplied by the browser.</p>
<p>Because it is the World Wide Web, HTML files also contain <em>hypertext links</em> to other web pages.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes links appear in the form of a button or an image.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes a web page contains
a form with a button that sends information to the web server.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Links are web addresses, or URLs,
and (you guessed it), they return files.</p>
<p>If the page is always the same, every time it is displayed by the web
browser, we say it is <em>static</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Webmasters don’t need software such as
Rails to deliver static documents; they just create files for delivery
by an ordinary <em>web server</em> program.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you learn HTML and create simple web
pages, you learn to upload files to a hosting service that provides web servers
that deliver your HTML files to web browsers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In principle, you can run a web server
delivering web pages from your computer at home but, in practice, most people want a web server
that runs 24 hours a day and is located in a <em>data center</em> that has fast and reliable
connections to the Internet.</p>
<p>Static websites are ideal for particle-physics papers (which was the
original use of the World Wide Web).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But most sites on the web,
especially those that allow a user to sign in, post comments, or order
products and services, generate web pages <em>dynamically</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you see a form
with a button, you probably are looking at a page that makes a request to a web application.</p>
<p>Dynamic websites often combine web pages with information from a
database.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A database stores information such as a user’s name, comments,
advertisements, or any other repetitive, structured
data.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A database <em>query</em> can provide a selection of data that customizes
a webpage for a particular user or changes the web page so it varies
with each visit.</p>
<p>Dynamic websites use a programming language such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby</a> to
assemble HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files on the fly from component files
or a database.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A software program written in Ruby and organized using
the Rails <em>development framework</em> is a Rails <em>web application</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A web
server program that runs Rails applications to generate dynamic web
pages is an <em>application server</em> (but usually we just call it a web
server).</p>
<p>Software such as Rails can access a database, combining the results of a
database query with static content to be delivered to a web browser as
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Keep in mind that the web browser only
receives ordinary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files; the files themselves
are assembled dynamically by the Rails application running on the
server.</p>
<p>Even if you are not going to use a database, there are good
reasons to generate a website using a programming language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example,
if you are creating several web pages, it often makes sense to assemble
an HTML file from smaller components.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, you might make a
small file that will be included on every page to make a footer (Rails
calls these “partials”).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Just as importantly, if you are using Rails,
you can add features to your website with code that has been developed
and tested by other people so you don’t have to build everything
yourself.</p>
<p>The widespread practice of sharing code with other developers for free,
and collaborating with strangers to build applications or tools, is
known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>open source</em></a> software
development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails is at the heart of a vibrant open source development
community, which means you leverage the work of tens of thousands of
skilled developers when you build a Rails application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When Ruby code is
packaged up for others to share, the package is called a <em>gem</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The name
is apt because shared code is valuable, like a gem.</p>
<p><em>Ruby</em> is a programming language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> <em>Rails</em> is a development framework.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails
is software code written in the Ruby language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is a <em>library</em> or
collection of gems that we add to the core Ruby language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> More importantly, Rails is a set of <em>structures and conventions</em> for building a web
application using the Ruby language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> By using Rails, you get well-tested code that implements
many of the most-needed features of a dynamic website.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you need additional features,
you can add additional gems.</p>
<p>With Rails, you will be using shared standard practices that make it
easier to collaborate with others and maintain your application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As an
example, consider the code that is used to access a database.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Using Ruby
without the Rails framework, or using another language such as PHP, you
could mix the complex programming code that accesses the database with
the code that generates HTML. With the insight of years of developers’
collective experience in maintaining and debugging such code, Rails
provides a library of code that segregates database access from the code
that displays pages, enforcing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>separation of
concerns</em></a>, and
making more modular, maintainable programs.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that’s how the web works, and why Rails is useful.</p>
<p>For more on the history of Rails, and an explanation of why it is popular, see the
next chapters.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But before we dive into Rails, let’s look at the increasingly
complex world of web development, particularly the difference between front-end
and back-end applications, and the programming languages we use, Ruby and JavaScript.</p>

<p>JavaScript and Ruby are both general-purpose programming languages.</p>
<p>Developers use other popular programming languages such as C, Python, and Java.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And developers like to talk about newer languages such as Elixir and Go, often <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparing the popularity</a> of programming languages.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most developers use only one or two popular languages on the job such as Ruby and JavaScript but hardcore programmers love to try new languages.</p>
<p>Just a note: Java and JavaScript are unrelated, except by name.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Java is a general-purpose language used in large enterprises, such as banking, where large teams of developers build applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> JavaScript is a language that was developed for use in web browsers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It was named “JavaScript” to take advantage of the popularity of Java but has little in common with Java except for the name.</p>
<p>And a further note: HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language, is not a programming language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is a <em>markup language</em> that uses tags to add structure and links to text.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It doesn’t allow <em>conditional execution</em> such as <code>if...<span class="intersentencespace"></span> then...<span class="intersentencespace"></span> else</code> which is key to programming.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you know HTML you can be a “coder,” writing HTML code, but you are not really a programmer.</p>

<p>Ruby is the programming language you’ll use when creating web
applications that run on your local computer or a remote server using
the Rails web application development framework.</p>
<p>JavaScript is the programming language that controls every web browser.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The companies that build web browsers (Google, Apple, Microsoft,
Mozilla, and others) agreed to use JavaScript as the standard browser
programming language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You might imagine an alternative universe in which
Ruby was the browser programming language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s not
the real world; plus it would be boring, as learning more than one
language makes us smarter and better programmers.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid12" data-tralics-id="cid12" class="section" data-number="3.4"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid12" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">3.4 </span>JavaScript and JQuery</a></h2>
<p>Though most of the code in Rails applications is written in Ruby,
developers add JavaScript to Rails applications to implement features
such as browser-based visual effects and user interaction.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For simple
Rails applications, you only need to learn Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For more sophisticated
web applications, you’ll need to know both Ruby and JavaScript.</p>
<p>JavaScript was first used on websites to add little features to the browser.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, JavaScript
can be used to display the current date and time on a web page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or JavaScript can be used to pop up
an annoying window when you try to leave a web page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There was little consistent structure to early JavaScript
programs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And because JavaScript is an older language without a built-on package manager, there were no
package libraries like Ruby gems to add functionality.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead, web developers shared scripts or snippets
of code to add commonly-implemented features.</p>
<div id="uid26" data-tralics-id="uid26" class="subsection" data-number="3.4.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid26" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">3.4.1 </span>JQuery</a></h3>
<p>In 2006, a group of developers released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jQuery</a>, a robust collection of
scripts that are a foundation for most of the simple interactive user features found on websites today.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails includes jQuery as part of any Rails application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll find jQuery on 65% of websites.</p>
<p>To understand jQuery, you need to know that every web browser takes an intermediate step between receiving an HTML file and displaying a web page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> After a web browser receives a file from a web server, it creates code in the computer’s memory that
describes the web page, complete with text and formatting, which we call the <em>Document Object Model</em>, or DOM.
JQuery scripts manipulate the DOM, which is the web browser’s internal representation of
web page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> JQuery commands make changes to the DOM. For example, you can write Javascript that replaces words on the page with different words.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or you can hide and reveal sections of the page.</p>
<p>Many Rails applications use jQuery or pure JavaScript to add interactive browser features.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Though it is easy to add JavaScript to web pages generated by Rails, the result is often “JavaScript gravy” or “soup:” a sloppy mix of JavaScript snippets and jQuery plugins poured over Rails views.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> After seeing applications built with JavaScript soup, developers often get an urge to adopt a framework like Rails for JavaScript, with standard structures and conventions to organize code.</p>
<p>We’ll look at JavaScript frameworks later in this chapter.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But first, consider a universe where JavaScript is the only language you need to know.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Not all developers use Rails; some use full-stack JavaScript.</p>

<p>In the last few years, developers have been improving the JavaScript language so
it can be used for server-side development as well as development of applications
that run in the browser.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> System administrators can install the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node.js</a> code library to enable
servers to run JavaScript.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Server-side JavaScript web application
frameworks are available, such as <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Express</a> and
<a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meteor</a>, but none are as popular as Ruby on
Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some code schools are now teaching “full stack JavaScript” using the
“MEAN Stack,” which combines four popular JavaScript technologies; MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.</p>
<p>There are at least a dozen popular languages that developers use to build web applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This will continue to be true.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Full-stack JavaScript is now an option but Rails is not going away.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For now, the Rails ecosystem is better known with more resources for building web applications and learning development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There will always be
jobs for Rails developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Startups will always be able to find developers who have experience with Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Your effort
in learning Rails will continue to be worthwhile.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, it is important to learn JavaScript as well.</p>

<div id="cid13" data-tralics-id="cid13" class="section" data-number="3.5"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid13" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">3.5 </span>Front and Back Ends</a></h2>
<p>We often talk about “front-end” and “back-end” development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The architecture of the web, split between
web browsers running on local computers and web application programs running on remote servers, is inherently <em>client-server</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When we write applications for both the front end and back end, we are <em>full-stack</em> developers.</p>
<p>Full-stack developers handle it all, including connections to database servers, server-side web applications, JavaScript for web browsers, and <em>system administration</em> of Unix servers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Increasingly, as web development gets more complex, there are fewer full-stack developers and more specialists.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you are building a web application for your own business, you may need to be a full-stack developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But if you look for a job, you may choose to specialize as a front-end or back-end developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Front-end developers have some design skill, worry a lot about user experience, and develop expertise with JavaScript.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Back-end developers don’t worry as much about design.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They focus on the architecture of applications, database structure, and application performance using Ruby.</p>
<p>Rails was originally created for full-stack development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Its <em>model-view-controller</em> architecture manages both connections to databases and display of web pages, requiring nothing more than the Ruby language and the Rails software library.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> JavaScript was originally created for front-end development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some developers now use JavaScript for full-stack development but it is still primarily used for adding interactive features to web pages.</p>
<p>Rails is popular for both the front end and the back end.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The conventions of building Rails applications are widely known and a developer can leverage the work of tens of thousands of other developers by including open-source gems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A Rails back end can connect to thousands of different services and efficiently handle traffic for any average website.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If your business is so successful that you must deal with problems of scale, you’ll find many Rails experts able to help.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For these reasons, developers continue to use Rails to build web applications, even as full-stack JavaScript grows in popularity.</p>
<p>JavaScript is becoming more popular but developers will continue to build full-stack Rails applications where complex JavaScript user interfaces are not required.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This could be quick “minimal viable product” (MVP) tests of business ideas or any project where it is too costly to invest in separate front-end and back-end development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you are going to quickly build a web application, and launch a business, just build it with Rails and don’t worry about implementing features in JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you want a complex front end that uses JavaScript extensively, you may still want to use Rails for the back end.</p>

<p>Rails 5.0 is the newest version of Rails.</p>
<p>Rails 5 recognizes the increasing use of Rails for back-end development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails 5 offers an option to build back-end-only applications that don’t generate browser views.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead, a stripped-down Rails 5 application returns data that can be consumed and displayed by another application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> With this approach, you can have Rails on the back end and a JavaScript web browser application, or a mobile application, on the front end.</p>
<p>With Rails 5, you can build a back-end application that just delivers data to a front-end application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Before Rails 5, most Rails applications generated entire web pages containing the results from a database query.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Now with Rails 5, Rails developers
have begun to build web applications that deliver just data, in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> With this approach, the Rails application provides an API, or <em>application programming interface</em>, that provides standardized responses to requests from an application in the hands of a user, which could be an IOS or Android application on a phone, or a JavaScript application running in a web browser.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve learned about the differences between front-end and back-end applications, let’s learn about popular JavaScript frameworks.</p>

<p>I’ve described Rails as a web development framework that uses the Ruby language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can also find web development frameworks that use the JavaScript language.</p>
<p>JavaScript frameworks were first developed so developers could build SPAs, <em>single-page applications</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Early examples of SPAs, such as Apple’s MobileMe or iWork in 2008, were attempts to use JavaScript to build desktop-like applications to run in the web browser.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The goal was to create RIAs, rich Internet applications, with similarities to software applications installed on the Mac or Windows, using JavaScript.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Of course, no one really wants desktop applications anymore.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We browse web pages to get information.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We install mobile apps to get access to services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes we want access to services in web browsers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But we don’t really want desktop applications in a web browser.</p>
<div id="uid28" data-tralics-id="uid28" class="subsection" data-number="3.7.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid28" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">3.7.1 </span>AngularJS and Ember.js</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ember.js</a> are the most popular JavaScript frameworks used to build single-page applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They provide the structure and conventions that developers want for maintainable code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For complex, richly interactive web applications, these frameworks get rid of the “JavaScript soup” that is common in Rails applications.</p>
<p>Unlike Rails, which is hugely popular, none of these JavaScript frameworks have achieved hegemony or dominance among developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For a learner, these frameworks require more programming experience than Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> All of these frameworks break the familiar request-response cycle of the web.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Just one URL delivers the entire single-page application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There are no web pages, only views that change completely or partially in response to user actions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Drawbacks to single-page applications are a slow initial load of the application, difficulty using analytics tools such as Google Analytics which rely on new pages loading in the browser, and views that won’t show up in Google search results.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For all these reasons, single-page applications are best used to deliver services, not information, and require advanced skills to develop.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid29" data-tralics-id="uid29" class="subsection" data-number="3.7.2"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid29" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">3.7.2 </span>React</a></h3>
<p>There’s a newer framework that can be used to dry up JavaScript soup.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s
<a href="http://reactjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a>, a JavaScript framework developed by engineers at Facebook.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It can be used for single-page applications or to organize JavaScript for interactive features in ordinary Rails applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Unlike AngularJS or Ember.js, React only manages views, not connections to databases or routing of requests, so it is not a full-stack framework, just a framework for the view layer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> React’s approach to building web pages is abstract and complex.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But React is a good choice for complex interactive features, if you’re determined to avoid JavaScript soup in your Rails application.</p>
<p>Ultimately, your decision to use JavaScript, and how much, depends on the kind of web application you want to build.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you want to build a product catalog, with many simple pages populated by a database, a full-stack Rails application may be all you need, perhaps with a few jQuery plugins.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If your application is like Facebook, with lots of interactive features and many different pages, React may be a good choice as part of a full-stack Rails application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you want to deliver a service such as live stock-market charts, you may want to build a complex single-page application using AngularJS or Ember.js, plus IOS and Android apps, connected to a Rails API server.</p>
<p>If you’re going to use JavaScript, either full-stack, or combined with Rails, use a JavaScript framework to avoid JavaScript soup.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> React could be a good place to start.</p>
<p>You’ll have a better idea of the importance of Rails if you understand “What is Rails?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Let’s look at that next.</p>

<p>Rails is a <em>library</em>, or collection of
code, plus <em>structures and conventions</em> for building a web application.</p>
<p>Technically, it is a package library (a RubyGem), that is installed
using the operating system command-line interface, and adds
functionality to the Ruby language.</p>
<p>Rails provides structures and conventions for web development, so less
code is required to build a web application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> All Rails
applications use the same structures, providing consistency
among applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Common and well-known conventions make it easy
for developers to collaborate on Rails applications and share
improvements and add-on code libraries with a wide community.</p>
<p>The structures and conventions of Rails are codified as the Rails API
(the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application programming interface</a>,
or directives that control the code).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The Rails API is documented <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>
and described in books, articles, and blog posts.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Learning Rails means

<p>Rails, in a larger sense, is more than a software library and an API. Rails is the central project of a vast community that produces software libraries that simplify the task of building complex websites.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Members of the Rails community share many core values, often use the same tools, and support each other with an informal network that is built on volunteerism.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Overlapping the informal community is an economic network that includes jobs, recruiters, consulting firms, conferences, businesses that build websites with Rails, and investors that fund startups.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails is popular among web startups, significantly because the pool of open source software libraries (RubyGems, or “gems”) makes it possible to build complex sites quickly.</p>
<p>This, then, is Rails: a software library and an API, plus a community of enthusiastic developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But to learn to use Rails, you’ll need to consider it from additional points of view.</p>

<p>To really understand Rails, and succeed in building Rails applications,
we need to consider Rails from six additional perspectives.</p>
<p>A parable from the
Indian subcontinent describes six blind men who encounter an elephant.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who
feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the
belly says the elephant is like a wall; and so on.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Like six blind
men encountering an elephant, it can be difficult to understand Rails
unless you look at it from multiple points of view.</p>
<p>Here are six different ways of looking at Rails.</p>
<div id="uid30" data-tralics-id="uid30" class="subsection" data-number="4.2.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid30" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">4.2.1 </span>Web Browser Perspective</a></h3>
<p>From the <strong>perspective of the web browser</strong>, Rails is simply a program
that generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These files are
generated dynamically.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can’t see the files on the server side but
you can view these files by using the web developer tools that are built
in to every browser.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Later you’ll examine these files when you learn to
troubleshoot a Rails application.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid31" data-tralics-id="uid31" class="subsection" data-number="4.2.2"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid31" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">4.2.2 </span>Programmer Perspective</a></h3>
<p>From the <strong>perspective of a programmer</strong>, Rails is a set of files
organized with a specific structure.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The structure is the same for every
Rails application; this makes it easy to collaborate
with other Rails developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We use text editors to edit these files to
make a web application.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid32" data-tralics-id="uid32" class="subsection" data-number="4.2.3"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid32" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">4.2.3 </span>Software Architect Perspective</a></h3>
<p>From the <strong>perspective of a software architect</strong>, Rails is a structure
of <em>abstractions</em> that enable programmers to collaborate and organize
their code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Thinking in abstractions means we group things in categories
and analyze relationships.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Conceptual categories and relationships can
be made “real” in code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Software programs are built of “concepts made
real” that are the moving parts of a software machine.</p>
<p>Notice that we are talking about abstractions, using language like
a philosopher.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most tutorials give you step-by-step instructions, like
following a recipe.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll get that in Book Two in this series.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But to really
understand programming, you should grasp that we are working with
“abstractions made real.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The area of your brain that follows instructions
is distinct from the area that thinks abstractly.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To be a programmer,
you’ll need both parts of the brain working together.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Don’t worry; I’ll
explain the abstractions in terms anyone can understand.</p>
<p>To a software architect, <em>classes</em> are the basic parts of a software machine.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A
class can represent something in the physical world as a collection of
various attributes or properties (for example, a User with a name,
password, and email address).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or a class can describe another
abstraction, such as a Number, with attributes such as quantity, and
behavior, such as “can be added and subtracted.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll get a better
grasp of classes in Book Two when you learn “Just Enough Ruby.”</p>
<p>To a software architect, Rails is a pre-defined set of classes that are
organized into a higher level of abstraction known as an API, or
<em>application programming interface</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails
API</a> is organized to conform to certain
widely known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>software design
patterns</em></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll become
familiar with these abstractions as you build a Rails application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In Book Two,
you’ll learn about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93View%E2%80%93Controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>model–view–controller</em></a>
design pattern.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As a beginner, you will see the MVC design pattern
reflected in the file structure of a Rails application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s where you
will first see “abstractions made real.”</p>

<p>We can look at Rails from the <strong>perspective of a gem hunter</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails is
popular because developers have written and shared many software
libraries (RubyGems, or “gems”) that provide useful features for
building websites.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We can think of a Rails application as a collection
of gems that provide basic functionality, plus custom code that adds
unique features for a particular website.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some gems are required by
every Rails application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, database adaptors enable Rails to
connect to databases.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Other gems are used to make development easier,
for example, gems for testing that help programmers find bugs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Still
other gems add functionality to the website, such as gems for logging in
users or processing credit cards.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Knowing what gems to use, and why, is
an important aspect of learning Rails.</p>

<p>We can also look at Rails from the <strong>perspective of a time traveler</strong> in
order to understand the importance of <em>software version control</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Specifically, we use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a> revision control
system to record a series of snapshots of your project’s filesystem.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Git
makes it easy to back up and recover files; more importantly, Git lets
you make exploratory changes, trying out code you may decide to discard,
without disturbing work you’ve done earlier.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can use Git with
<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, a popular “social coding” website, for
remote backup of your projects and community collaboration.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Git can keep
multiple versions (“branches”) of your local code in sync with a remote
GitHub repository, making it possible to collaborate with others on open
source or proprietary projects.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Strictly speaking, Git and GitHub are
not part of Rails (they are tools that can be used on any development
project).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And there are several other version control systems that are
used in open source development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But a professional Rails developer uses
Git and GitHub constantly on any real-world Rails project.</p>

<p>Finally, we can consider a Rails application from the <strong>perspective of a
tester</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Software testing is part of Rails culture; Rails is the first
web development platform to make testing an integrated part of
development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Before Rails, automated testing was rarely part of web
development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A web application would be tested by users and (maybe) a QA
team.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If automated tests were used, the tests were often written after
the web application was largely complete.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails introduced the
discipline of Test-Driven Development (TDD) to the wider web development
community.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> With TDD, tests are often written <em>before</em> any implementation
coding.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It may seem odd to write tests first, but for a skilled TDD
practitioner, it brings coherence to the programming process.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First, the
developer will give thought to what needs to be accomplished and think
through alternatives and edge cases.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Second, the developer will have
complete test coverage for the project.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> With good test coverage, it is
easier to <em>refactor</em>, rearranging code to be more elegant or efficient.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Running a test suite after refactoring provides assurance that nothing
inadvertently broke after the changes.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> TDD is seen as a necessary skill
of an experienced Rails developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Book Two will introduce you to the
basic concepts of test-driven development and show you how to write
simple tests.</p>
<p>You’ve seen Rails from six different perspectives.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You understand Rails
is a software library plus an API, as well as a community of developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Now let’s dive deeper and consider how Rails fits in to a larger
<em>technology stack</em> and how it can vary within the stack.</p>
</div></div>
<div id="cid19" data-tralics-id="cid19" class="section" data-number="4.3"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid19" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">4.3 </span>Understanding Stacks</a></h2>
<p>To understand Rails from the perspective of a professional Rails
developer, you’ll need to grasp the idea of a <em>technology stack</em> and
recognize that Rails can have more than one stack.</p>
<div id="uid38" data-tralics-id="uid38" class="subsection" data-number="4.3.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid38" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">4.3.1 </span>Full Stack</a></h3>
<p>A technology stack is a set of technologies or software libraries that
are used to develop an application or deliver web pages.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> “Stack” is a
term that is used loosely and descriptively.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is a collection of
technologies that fit together, interacting with each other, and
providing different types of services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We say “stack” because we
use different software systems or software libraries as if they
were building blocks or bricks deployed in layers.</p>
<p>Often we consider a stack as layers added to the operating system.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For a web application, we need a web server, a database, a
programming language, and perhaps additional software libraries.</p>
<p>Earlier we learned that full-stack developers have skills to work with
operating systems, web servers, databases, web applications, and
JavaScript programs in a web browser.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s a formidable stack
of technologies.</p>
<p>There is no organization
that tells you what building blocks you must use.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As a technologist,
your choice of stack reflects your experience, values, and personal
preference, just like religion or favorite beverage.</p>
<p>For example, Mark Zuckerberg developed Facebook in 2004 using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LAMP</a> application
stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux (operating system)
</li>
<li>Apache (web server)
</li>
<li>MySQL (database)
</li>
<li>PHP (programming language)
</li></ul>
<p>Zuckerberg chose an operating system, a web server, a database, and a
programming language with which he was comfortable.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In 2004, Rails
was not well known and Zuckerberg chose to implement his ideas using PHP
without any additional web application software library.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, your application stack will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacOS, Linux, or Windows
</li>
<li>Puma (web server)
</li>
<li>SQLite (database)
</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails (language and framework)
</li></ul>
<p>You’ll use an operating system that’s familiar to you, a basic web server that comes with Ruby,
a database that’s preinstalled with Mac or Linux operating system, the Ruby language, and the
Rails web application software library.</p>

<div id="uid47" data-tralics-id="uid47" class="subsection" data-number="4.3.2"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid47" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">4.3.2 </span>Rails Stacks</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes when we talk about a stack, we only care about part of a
larger stack.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, a Rails stack includes the gems we choose to
add features to a website or make development easier.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When we select the
gems we’ll use for a Rails application, we’re choosing a stack or layers of
services we need just for a web application.</p>
<p>Sometimes the choice of components is driven by the requirements of an
application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At other times, the stack is a matter of personal
preference.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Just as craftsmen and aficionados debate the merits of
favorite tools and techniques in any profession, Rails developers avidly
dispute what’s the best Rails stack for development.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://37signals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37signals</a>, where the creator of
Rails works, uses this Rails stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>ERB for view templates
</li>
<li>MySQL for databases
</li>
<li>Minitest for testing
</li></ul>
<p>It is not important (at this point) to know what the acronyms mean
(we’ll learn later).</p>
<p>Another stack is more popular among Rails developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haml for view templates
</li>
<li>PostgreSQL for databases
</li>
<li>RSpec for testing
</li></ul>
<p>We’ll learn later what the terms mean.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For now, just recognize that
parts of the Rails framework can be swapped out, just like making
substitutions when you order from a menu at a restaurant.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The Rails stack
can vary, and it is part of a larger stack that includes an operating system,
web server, and database.</p>
<p>You can learn much about Rails by following the experts’ debates about
the merits of a favorite stack.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The debates are a source of much
innovation and improvement for the Rails framework.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the end, the
power of the crowd prevails; usually the best components in the Rails
stack are the most popular.</p>
<p>The proliferation of choices for the Rails stack can make learning
difficult, particularly because the components used by many leading
Rails developers are not the components used in many beginner tutorials.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In this tutorial, we stick to solid ground where there is no debate.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In
the advanced <a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capstone Rails Tutorials</a>,
we’ll explore stack choices and choose
components that are most often used by professional developers.</p>

<p>Before you start building an application with Rails, it may help to know why developers like using Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This chapter looks at the history of Rails, its organizing principles, and the reasons for its popularity.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First, though, we’ll consider Ruby, the language used for Rails.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid21" data-tralics-id="cid21" class="section" data-number="5.1"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid21" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.1 </span>Why Ruby?</a></h2>
<p>Ruby is a programming language, created 20 years ago by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> By most measures of programming language popularity, Ruby <a href="https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranks among the top ten</a>, though usually as tenth (or so) in popularity, and largely due to the popularity of Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Like Java or the C language, Ruby is a general-purpose programming language, though it is best known for its use in web programming.</p>
<p>In a podcast from <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/1-0-5-homerun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Developer’s Life</a> and in an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2005/08/30/ruby-rails-david-heinemeier-hansson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview from 2005</a>, David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Rails, describes building an online project management application named BaseCamp in 2004.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> He had been using the PHP programming language because he could get things done quickly but was frustrated because of a lack of abstraction and frequently repetitive code that made PHP “dirty.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Hansson wanted to use the “clean” software enginering abstractions supported in the Java programming language but found development in Java was cumbersome.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> He tried Ruby and was excited about the ease of use (he calls it pleasure) he found in the Ruby language.</p>
<p>Ruby is known among programmers for a terse, uncluttered syntax that doesn’t require a lot of extra punctuation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Compared to Java, Ruby is streamlined, with less code required to create basic structures such as data fields.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Ruby is a modern language that makes it easy to use high-level abstractions such as metaprogramming.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In particular, metaprogramming makes it easy to develop a “domain specific language” that customizes Ruby for a particular set of uses (Rails and many gems use this “DSL” capability).</p>
<p>Ruby’s key advantage is RubyGems, the package manager that makes it easy to create and share software libraries (gems) that extend Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> RubyGems provides a simple system to install gems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Anyone can upload a gem to the central RubyGems website, making the gem immediately available for installation by anyone.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The RubyGems website is where you’ll obtain the most recent version of Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And it is where you will obtain all the gems that help you build complex websites.</p>
<p>Ruby has several disadvantages (at least when programmers want to argue).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Its processing performance is slow relative to C++ or Java.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The execution speed of a language is seldom important, though, relative to the benefits gained by programmer productivity and the general level of performance required by most websites.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For websites that require lots of simultaneous activity, Ruby is not well-suited to the sophisticated software engineering required to execute simultaneous activity efficiently (standard Ruby lacks “parallelism”, though some versions support it).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Lastly, some programmers complain that Ruby programs (and especially Rails) contain “too much magic” (that is, complex operations that are hidden behind simple directives).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These concerns haven’t stopped Rails from becoming a popular web development platform.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid22" data-tralics-id="cid22" class="section" data-number="5.2"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid22" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.2 </span>Why Rails?</a></h2>
<p>Rails is popular and widely used because its conventions are pervasive and astute.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Any web application has complex requirements that include basic functions such as generating HTML, processing form submissions, or accessing a database.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Without a web application development framework, a programmer has a mammoth task to implement all the required infrastructure.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Even with a web application development framework, a programmer can take an idiosyncratic approach, building something that no one else can easily take apart and understand.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The singular virtue of Rails is that Heinemeier Hansson, and the core team that joined him, decided that there is one best way to implement much of the infrastructure required by a web application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Many of the implementation decisions appear arbitrary.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In fact, though Heinemeier Hansson is often lambasted as autocratic in his approach to improving Rails, the Rails API reflects deep experience and intelligence in implementing the requirements of a web application development framework.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The benefit is that every developer who learns the “Rails way” produces a web application that any other Rails developer can unravel and understand more quickly than if they encountered idiosyncratic code without as many conventions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That means collaboration is easier, development is quicker, and there’s a larger pool of open source libraries to enhance Rails.</p>
<p>The advantage of establishing conventions might seem obvious, but when Rails was released in 2004, web development was dominated by PHP, which lent itself to idiosyncratic code produced by solo webmasters, and Java frameworks such as Struts, which were often seen as burdened by an excess of structure.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Other frameworks, such as Apple’s WebObjects, Adobe’s ColdFusion, and Microsoft’s .NET Framework, were in wide use but the frameworks were products controlled by the companies and built by small teams, which tended to restrict innovation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Today PHP, Java frameworks, and .NET remain popular, largely among solo webmasters (PHP), enterprise teams (Java), and Windows aficionados (.NET) but Rails has become very popular and has influenced development of other server-side frameworks.</p>
<p>The design decisions that went into the first version of Rails anchored a virtuous circle that led to Rails’s growth.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Within the first year, Rails caught the attention of prominent software engineers, notably Martin Fowler and Dave Thomas (proponents of agile software development methodologies).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails is well-matched to the practices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agile software development</a>, particular in its emphasis on software testing and “convention over configuration.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The interest and advocacy of opinion leaders from the agile camp led to greater visibility in the wider open source community, culminating in a <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keynote lecture by Heinemeier Hansson</a> at the 2005 O’Reilly Open Source Convention.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Because Rails was adopted by software engineers who are influencers and trend setters, it is often said that Rails is favored by “the cool kids.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If that is so, it is largely because Rails is well-suited to software engineering practices that are promoted by thought leaders like Fowler and Thomas.</p>

<p>The popularity of Rails is an outgrowth of the Rails “philosophy” or guiding principles.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you read blogs by Rails developers, you’ll often see references to these principles.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Understanding these principles will help you make sense of Rails or, at least, some of the debates on developer blogs.</p>
<div id="uid54" data-tralics-id="uid54" class="subsection" data-number="5.3.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid54" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.3.1 </span>Rails is Opinionated</a></h3>
<p>In the mid-1990s, web applications were often written in Perl, a programming language that promised, “There’s more than one way to do it.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Perl is a prime example of “non-opinionated” software; there’s no “right way” or “best way” to solve programming problems in Perl.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Famously, Perl’s <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> states, “In general, [Perl’s built-in functions] do what you want, unless you want consistency.”</p>
<p>In contrast, Rails is said to be “opinionated.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There is a “Rails way” for many of the problems that must be solved by a web application developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you follow the Rails conventions, you’ll have fewer decisions to make and you’ll find more of what you need is already built.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The benefit is faster development, improved collaboration, and easier maintenance.</p>

<p>Omakase is a Japanese phrase that means “I’ll leave it to you.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Customers at sushi restaurants can order omakase, entrusting the chef to make a pleasing selection instead of making their own à la carte choices.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In a famous essay Heinemeier Hansson declared <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2012/rails-is-omakase.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails is Omakase</a>, and said, “A team of chefs picked out the ingredients, designed the APIs, and arranged the order of consumption on your behalf according to their idea of what would make for a tasty full-stack framework….<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When we, or in some cases I — as the head chef of the omakase experience that is Rails — decide to include a dish, it’s usually based on our distilled tastes and preferences.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’ve worked in this establishment for a decade.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’ve poured well in the excess of ten thousand hours into Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This doesn’t make my tastes right for you, but it certainly means that they’re well formed.”</p>
<p>Understanding that Rails is omakase means accepting that many of the opinions enshrined in the Rails API are the decisions of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benevolent Dictator for Life</a>, informed by discussion with other developers who have made significant contributions to the Rails code base.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For the most part, Heinemeier Hansson’s “opinions” will serve you well.</p>

<p>“Convention over configuration” is an example of Rails as “opinionated software.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is an extension of the concept of a default, a setting or value automatically assigned without user intervention.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some software systems, notably Java web application frameworks, need multiple configuration files, each with many settings.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, a configuration file might specify that a database table named “sales” corresponds to a class named “Sales.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The configuration file permits flexibility (a developer can easily change the setting if the table is named “items_sold”).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead of relying on extensive configuration files, Rails makes assumptions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> By convention, if you create a model object in Rails named “User,” it will save data to a database table named “users” without any configuration required.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails will also assume the table name is plural if the class name is singular.</p>
<p>“Convention over configuration” means you’ll be productive.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You won’t spend time setting up configuration files.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll spend less time thinking about where things go and what names to assign.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And, because other developers have learned the same conventions, it is easier to collaborate.</p>

<p>Known by the acronym DRY, “Don’t Repeat Yourself” is a principle of software development formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas and widely advocated among Rails developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In its simplest form, it is an admonition to avoid duplication.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When code is duplicated, an application becomes more complex, making it more difficult to maintain and more vulnerable to unintended behavior (bugs).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The DRY principle can be extended to development processes as well as code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, manual testing is repetititive; automated testing is DRY. Software design patterns that introduce abstraction or indirection can make code more DRY; for example, by eliminating repetitive if-then logic.</p>
<p>Code reuse is a fundamental technique in software development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It existed long before Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas promoted the DRY principle.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails takes advantage of Ruby’s metaprogramming features to not just reuse code but eliminate code where possible.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> With a knowledge of Rails conventions, it’s possible to create entire simple web applications with only a few lines of code.</p>

<p>The risk that “convention over configuration” leads to obscurity is compounded by the “Don’t Repeat Yourself” principle.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To avoid repetitive code, Rails often will offer default behavior that looks like magic because the underlying implementation is hidden in the depths of the Rails code library.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can implement a simple web application with only a few lines of custom code but you may wonder where all the behavior comes from.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This can be frustrating when, as a beginner, you attempt to customize your application to do more than what’s shown in simple tutorials.</p>

<p>Rails is popular.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails is powerful.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But Rails isn’t easy to learn.</p>
<p>You may have heard of a psychological phenomenon called “resistance.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When we struggle with something new, or must adapt to the unfamiliar, we
resist.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We get discouraged.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We complain.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes we feel we should
quit.</p>
<p>This chapter is here to help with your resistance.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to acknowledge that, yes, <em>Rails can be difficult</em>.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people are successfully using Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’ll hazard a
guess that none are significantly smarter, more motivated, or a better
student than you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Perhaps some of them had more time to study or better
access to mentors, but these factors simply accelerate the speed of
learning Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you get discouraged, or think Rails is too hard,
recognize that you are encountering your own resistance, not any genuine
limitation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Take a break, set aside your learning materials, and come
back when your natural curiosity and eagerness has returned.</p>
<p>Sometimes resistance attaches to imaginary problems (like “I’m not smart
enough”).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Just as often, resistance attaches to real problems, but
magnifies them into insurmountable obstacles (“Rails is impossible to
use on Windows!”).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The best way to overcome these obstacles is to
acknowledge the resistance, investigate the obstacle, and seek support
from peers.</p>
<p>This chapter describes some of things that make Rails difficult.</p>
<p>These Rails challenges are obstacles, but other people overcame them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can, too.</p>

<div id="uid62" data-tralics-id="uid62" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid62" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.1 </span>It is difficult to install Ruby.</a></h3>
<p>The installation process for Ruby on Rails is more difficult than
downloading and installing any consumer software applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You are
setting up a development environment and you need system software as
well as Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Depending on what you’ve done before, you may have altered
your system, introducing potentials for conflicts.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Book Two provides
links to good installation guides in the “Get Started” chapter.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But
installation instructions can’t accommodate the specific configuration
of your computer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes you just have to look for someone to help.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can also use a hosted development environment, such as <a href="https://c9.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud9</a>.</p>

<div id="uid63" data-tralics-id="uid63" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.2"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid63" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.2 </span>Rails is a nightmare on Windows.</a></h3>
<p>Windows is very popular, so why is it difficult to develop with Rails on
Windows?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It seems the Rails community has a bias against Windows.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It
does, and there’s a reason.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails is an open source project.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most open
source developers use Unix-based system tools.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is difficult and
time-consuming to convert Unix-based system tools to the Microsoft
Windows operating system.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Open source developers prefer to spend their
time maintaining and improving their Unix-based projects.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And expert
Windows developers are seldom interested in porting Unix-based system
tools to Windows.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So system utilities such as RVM are not available for
Windows.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And developers who create gems are seldom interested in
spending time to solve the problems that arise when code has to be
adapted for the idiosyncrasies of the Windows platform.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This situation
is not going to change, so you have to make a choice.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Stay with Windows
or get comfortable with Unix-based systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid64" data-tralics-id="uid64" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.3"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid64" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.3 </span>Why do I have to learn Git?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is difficult.</a></h3>
<p>Real software development requires version control and Git is the
standard tool for Rails developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If all you do is build applications
as a classroom exercise, you don’t need to learn Git.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can skip all
the parts of the book that mention Git.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But sooner or later, if you
start doing real projects, you’ll need Git.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Simple Git commands are not
difficult to learn.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you’ve developed your skills and confidence you
can learn the more advanced Git functions, such as branching.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid65" data-tralics-id="uid65" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.4"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid65" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.4 </span>Why worry about versions?</a></h3>
<p>For simple projects you don’t need version management.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> My books introduce version management and
prepare you to handle version conflicts.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As you tackle more complex
projects, and as new versions of Rails are released, you’ll face version
issues and version management will be helpful.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid66" data-tralics-id="uid66" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.5"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid66" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.5 </span>Do I really need to learn about testing?</a></h3>
<p>For student projects, no, you don’t need to learn about testing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But as
soon as money or reputation is at stake on a project, you’ll need to
begin using test-driven development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Book Two introduces TDD but you’ll
need intermediate-level tutorials to develop proficiency.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Once you’ve
grasped the basics, testing will become easy, and it actually is fun and
satisfying.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid67" data-tralics-id="uid67" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.6"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid67" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.6 </span>Rails error reporting is cryptic.</a></h3>
<p>Actually, Rails error reporting is quite good.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Stack traces are detailed
and error messages are descriptive.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Beginners have a problem because the
stack traces and error messages provide a technical analysis of a
problem in terms that an experienced developer can understand.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If error
reporting was “simplified” it might not be as intimidating but it would
not as accurate.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s up to you to gain enough knowledge to understand
the error messages.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Finally, the error reporting mechanism can point you
to the line in your code that triggers a problem, but it can’t know what
you trying to do, or describe the error in anything but technical terms.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid68" data-tralics-id="uid68" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.7"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid68" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.7 </span>There is too much magic.</a></h3>
<p>The Rails “convention over configuration” principle leads to obscurity.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Default behavior often looks like magic because the underlying
implementation is hidden in the depths of the Rails code library.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you
like to know how things work, this can be frustrating.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You really have
only two choices when you encounter Rails magic.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can take time to
dig into the source code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you do so, you’ll encounter frustration as
you encounter complex and sophisticated code, but you may also improve
your understanding and skill as a Ruby programmer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or you can take on
faith that “it just works.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Often, you just need to use the convention
several times in different projects to get comfortable with the magic
and stop worrying that you don’t fully understand it.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid69" data-tralics-id="uid69" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.8"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid69" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.8 </span>It is difficult to grasp MVC and REST.</a></h3>
<p>Even if you learn that the acronyms mean <em>model-view-controller</em> and <em>representational state transfer</em>,
MVC and REST are abstract concepts.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you simply follow a tutorial, the author will
show you how to build an application that uses MVC or REST, but you won’t see any alternative,
or understand why MVC or REST are best practices.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When it is time to build your own
application, if you don’t understand the importance of <em>separation of concerns</em> you won’t be
sure how to structure your application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Understanding software architecture requires
abstract reasoning, imagination, and experience, which takes time.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is difficult to
grasp but approach it with curiosity, seek explanations, and you’ll grasp it soon enough.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid70" data-tralics-id="uid70" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.9"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid70" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.9 </span>Rails contains lots of things I don’t understand.</a></h3>
<p>If you look at the Rails directory structure, you’ll see many files and
folders.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you look at the Rails API, or pick up a Ruby tutorial,
you’ll also see code that is unfamiliar.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Book Two describes some of
what you see.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As you build more applications, you will gain proficiency
and master more of Rails and Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Yet even as you gain mastery of
Rails, there will be aspects that remain unfamiliar.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Don’t let the sheer
complexity stop you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The truth is, you don’t have to know “all” of Rails
or Ruby to build web applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid71" data-tralics-id="uid71" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.10"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid71" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.10 </span>There is too much to learn.</a></h3>
<p>Very true.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To be a full-stack web developer you need to know HTML,
JavaScript, CSS, Ruby, testing, databases, and much, much more.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You
might think that developers who started ten years ago have an advantage
because there wasn’t as much to learn when they started.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But today there
are many more high-quality tutorials and educational programs to
accelerate your learning.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And resources like Google and Stack Overflow
have many more answers to questions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As the knowledge domain has grown,
so have the learning resources.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You don’t have to learn everything.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Get
a foundation in the basics and then dive deep as a specialist in an area
that appeals to you.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid72" data-tralics-id="uid72" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.11"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid72" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.11 </span>It is difficult to find up-to-date advice.</a></h3>
<p>Rails has been around since 2004 with major new versions released every
two years.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Chances are, answers to questions you find on Stack Overflow
or Google were written for an older version of Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There is no easy
way to determine if the answer is out of date.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A particular aspect of
Rails may have changed—or not.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Even worse, the answer may work,
but there may be a better way that reflects current best practices.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To
filter the outdated in Google, use the “Search Tools” options for
specifying a timeframe.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Look closely at the date of a blog posting or
Stack Overflow answer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Try to find a newer answer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Usually, if there are
a series of answers and things have changed, you’ll see the current best
answer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re uncertain, don’t be shy about posting your question to
Stack Overflow.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> More importantly, make it your business to keep up with
the community, reading Peter Cooper’s <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby
Weekly</a> email newsletter or his daily
<a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RubyFlow</a> site.</p>

<p>There are so many gems available for Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some add useful features,
like tagging or a mailing list API. Some are basic, such as gems for a
database or front-end framework.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Even among basic gems, Rails offers
choices.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Which are best?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The <a href="https://ruby-toolbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby Toolbox</a>
can help, but mostly you will find guidance from looking at example
projects and noticing what other developers are using.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s wisdom in
the crowd.</p>

<p>If you look at the <a href="https://railsapps.github.io/rails-release-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Release History</a> you’ll
see there is a new major release approximately every 1.5 years.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each
major release is well tested and relatively free of bugs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But new
features or new approaches often require rewrites of older applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Commercial software products often make a priority of keeping the API
consistent over time.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s not Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails is an open source project
and the core team embraces innovation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The maintainers expect that
you’ll keep up with changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid76" data-tralics-id="uid76" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.14"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid76" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.14 </span>It is difficult to transition from tutorials to building real applications.</a></h3>
<p>Copying and pasting from tutorials is a good way to begin learning
Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But you’ll only become a skilled Rails developer when you build
something that is not shown in a tutorial.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The first few hours (or days)
when you start building a custom application can be very difficult.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Focus on the basics that are described in this book.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Start with user
stories.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Build pieces that you know how to do.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Look for code samples on
blogs or GitHub or Stack Overflow.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Try “spikes,” little experiments that
test ideas for implementation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Seek advice from peers or mentors.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At
first it will be slow going.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But you will pick up momentum.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The chapter,
“Crossing the Chasm,” will provide specific strategies to help.</p>

<div id="uid77" data-tralics-id="uid77" class="subsection" data-number="6.1.15"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid77" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">6.1.15 </span>I’m not sure where the code goes.</a></h3>
<p>If you follow tutorials, you’ll learn “where the code goes” with the
model–view–controller design pattern.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> With a sense of the
request-response cycle, RESTful actions in the controller, and a few
guidelines such as “skinny controller, fat model” you’ll be able to
build intermediate-level Rails applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Front-end code,
particularly JavaScript, can be difficult because not a lot has been
published about Rails best practices.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In particular, the Rails asset
pipeline can be confusing for anyone who has done front-end development
without Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you don’t know what you’re supposed to do, do whatever
works, then look for someone who can help you by providing a code
review.</p>
</div>

<p>Until recently in most countries, most Rails developers have been young men with an
engineering background.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For people who don’t fit the stereotypical
profile, it can be hard to find role models or peers who demonstrate
that Rails is something everyone can learn.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The challenge can be subtle,
as when you have the feeling that maybe if you were different you’d find
it easier to make progress.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or the challenge can be overt, when behavior
of fellow students or co-workers is disturbing or hurtful (often they
don’t even know!).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Lack of diversity, and the cluelessness that
accompanies it, is unfortunate in the Rails community.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But many people
are working to make the community more welcoming and inclusive.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Organizations such as <a href="http://railsgirls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails Girls</a> and
<a href="http://railsbridge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railsbridge</a> are creating more diversity in
the community.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You may find support from peers there to affirm that you,
too, are entitled to knowledge and success.</p>
<p>These are some of the challenges you will face in learning and using Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Next,
we will look at how to get help.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’m asked, “Where’s the Rails manual?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There isn’t one.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> No single
document tells you how to use Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead, there’s a wealth of

</li></ul>
<p>What will you do when you get stuck?</p>
<p>“Google it,” of course.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But here’s a trick to keep in mind.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Google has
options under “Search tools” to show only recent results from the past
year.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Use it to filter out stale advice that pertains only to older
versions of Rails.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow</a> is as
important as Google for finding answers to programming problems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Stack
Overflow answers are often included in Google search results, but you
can go directly to Stack Overflow to search for answers to your
questions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Like Google, answers from Stack Overflow are helpful if you
check carefully to make sure the answers are recent.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Also be sure to
compare answers to similar questions; the most popular answer is not
always the correct answer to your particular problem.</p>
<p>Requests for advice (especially anything that provokes opinions) are
often rejected on Stack Overflow.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead, try Reddit for advice or
recommendations.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll find discussion forums (“subreddits”) devoted to
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails</a> and

<p>I’d like to urge you to find ways you can work with others who are
learning Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Peer support is really important when you face a
challenge and want to overcome obstacles.</p>
<p>Most large urban areas have meetups or user group meetings for Rails
developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Try <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meetup.com</a> or google “ruby
rails (my city)”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The community of Rails developers is friendly and
eager to help beginners.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you are near a Rails meetup, it is really
worthwhile to connect to other developers for help and support.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You may
find a group that meets weekly for beginners who study together.</p>
<p>Local user groups often sponsor hack nights or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hackathons</a> which can be
evening or weekend collaborative coding sessions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You don’t have to be
an expert.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Beginners are welcome.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can bring your own project which
can be as simple as completing a tutorial.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You will likely find a study
partner at your level or a mentor to help you learn.</p>
<p>If you are a woman learning Rails, look for one of the free workshops
from <a href="http://railsbridge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RailsBridge</a> or <a href="http://railsgirls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails
Girls</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These are not exclusively for women;
everyone considered a “minority” in the tech professions is encouraged
to participate; and men are included when invited by a woman colleague
or friend.</p>

<p>Learning to code is challenging, especially if you do it alone.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Make it
social and you’ll learn faster and have more fun.</p>
<p>There’s a popular trend in the workplace for programmers to work
side-by-side on the same code, sharing a keyboard and screen.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s
effective, both to increase productivity and to share knowledge, and
many coders love it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When programmers are not in the same office, they
share a screen remotely and communicate with video chat.</p>
<p>Look for opportunities to pair program.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s the best way to learn to
code, even if your pairing partner is only another beginner.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Learn more
about pair programming on the site
<a href="http://www.pairprogramwith.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pairprogramwith.me</a> and find a pairing
partner at <a href="http://www.codermatch.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codermatch.me</a> or
<a href="http://www.letspair.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letspair.net</a>.</p>
<p>Remote pair programming requires tools for screen sharing and video
chat.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Pairing sessions often use:</p>
<ul>

<p>By far, the best way to learn is to have a mentor at your side as you
undertake a project.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That is an opportunity that is seldom available,
unless you’ve been hired to be part of a team in a company that
encourages pair programming.</p>
<p>You can try <a href="http://www.railsmentors.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RailsMentors</a>, a network of

<p>Code review is an essential part of the development process.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s
always more than one way to implement a feature, and some ways are
better than others, but you may not know it unless you ask someone to
look at your code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you pair with a mentor, you get the benefit of
code review.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But even if you don’t have a mentor, you can get code
review online.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> StackExchange, the parent of StackOverflow, has a free
site for code review:</p>

<p>Tutorials from other authors focus only on coding.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But Rails developers
do more than code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Software development is a process that begins with
planning and ends with analysis and review.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Coding, testing, and
deployment is at the core but you’ll need to learn about the entire
process to succeed professionally.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s why we look at product
planning and project management.</p>
<p>For this beginning tutorial, we’ll introduce concepts about product
planning and project management that you will encounter as a Rails
developer.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid36" data-tralics-id="cid36" class="section" data-number="8.1"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid36" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">8.1 </span>Product Owner</a></h2>
<p>On your project, who is the <em>product owner</em>?</p>
<p>The product owner is the advocate for the customer, making sure that the
team creates value for the users.</p>
<p>If you are a solo operator, you are the one who will decide what
features and functionality will be included in your application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But if
you’re part of a team, either in a startup, as a consultant, or in a
corporate setting, it may not be clear who has responsibility for
looking at the application from the point of view of the application
user.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Someone must decide which features and functionality are essential
and which must be left out.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We call this <em>managing scope</em> and combating
<em>feature creep</em>.</p>
<p>It’s important to assign a product owner.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Without a product owner in
charge, tasks remain vague and developers have difficulty making
progress.</p>
<p>In large organizations, a product owner may be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product
manager</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project
manager</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A product owner
usually is not a management executive (though there will likely be an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_sponsor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive sponsor</a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Everyone on the team — including management, developers, and
stakeholders — should agree to designate a product owner and give that
person authority to define features and requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid37" data-tralics-id="cid37" class="section" data-number="8.2"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid37" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">8.2 </span>User Stories</a></h2>
<p>A product owner’s principal tool for product planning is the <em>user
story</em>.</p>
<p>In the past, when software engineering primarily served government or
large corporations, product planning started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_gathering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>requirements
gathering</em></a> defined
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>use cases</em></a>, and culminated
in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Requirements_Specification" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>requirements
specification</em></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> User stories are a faster, more flexible approach to product planning
that originated with an approach called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agile software
development</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User stories</a> are a way to
discuss and describe the requirements for a software application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The
process of writing user stories helps a product owner identify all the
features that are needed for an application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Breaking down the
application’s functionality into discrete user stories helps organize
the work and track progress toward completion.</p>
<p>User stories are often expressed in the following format:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nf">As a</span>
<span class="k">I </span><span class="nf">want</span>
<span class="nf">In order to</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nf">*Join Mailing List*</span>
<span class="nf">As a visitor to the website</span>
<span class="k">I </span><span class="nf">want to join a mailing list</span>
<span class="nf">In order to receive news and announcements</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>A typical application has dozens of user stories, from basic sign-in
requirements to the particular functionality that makes the application
unique.</p>
<p>You don’t need special software to write user stories.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Just use index
cards or a Word document.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the next chapter, we’ll see how you can
enter user stories as tasks in a to-do list.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here’s the format:</p>

<p>Just like Rails provides a structure for building a web application,
user stories provide a structure for organizing your product plan.</p>

<div id="cid38" data-tralics-id="cid38" class="section" data-number="8.3"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid38" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">8.3 </span>Wireframes and Mockups</a></h2>
<p>Often, before writing user stories, a product owner will make rough
sketches of various web pages.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sketching is a phase where you try out
ideas to clarify your vision for the application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sketching can lead to
a wireframe or a mockup.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These terms are often used interchangeably but
there are differences in meaning.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>wireframe</em></a> is a
drawing showing all functional elements of a web page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It should not
depict a proposed graphic design for a website, rather it should be a
diagram of a web page, without color or graphics.</p>
<p>A <em>mockup</em> adds graphic design to a wireframe; including branding
devices, color, and placeholder content.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A mockup gives an impression of
the website’s “personality” as well as proposed functionality.</p>
<p>One of the most popular tools for creating wireframes is <a href="http://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balsamiq
Mockups</a> (despite the name, it
produces wireframes, not mockups).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There are dozens of others listed in
the article <a href="https://railsapps.github.io/rails-product-planning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails and Product
Planning</a>.</p>
<p>As a product owner, writing user stories or sketching wireframes will
help you refine product requirements.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some people like a visual approach
with wireframes; others prefer words and narrative.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Either approach will
work; both are good.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid39" data-tralics-id="cid39" class="section" data-number="8.4"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid39" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">8.4 </span>Graphic Design</a></h2>
<p>Very few people have skills as both a visual designer and a programmer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The tools are different; graphic designers typically use Adobe
Photoshop, though web-savvy designers often create designs directly in
HTML and CSS, while developers write code.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky, you will work with a skilled graphic designer as you
build your web application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you are very lucky, you may work with
someone who is a <em>user experience</em> (UX) designer or <em>interaction
designer</em> (IxD).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Interaction design is a demanding, sophisticated
discipline that requires the mindset of an anthropologist and the eye of
a visual artist to find not just the most pleasing, but the most
effective visual design for an application user interface.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can find
interaction designers discussing their concerns on the
<a href="http://www.ixda.org/discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IxDA</a> website, including <a href="http://www.ixda.org/node/19039" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the
differences</a> between interaction design
and UX design.</p>
<p>If you’re working with a graphic designer you might collaborate on a
<em>moodboard</em> or a <em>design brief</em> to define the look and feel of your
application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If the designer works in Photoshop, you’ll face the
challenge of converting design layouts from Photoshop to HTML and CSS.
There are service firms that do this for a fee but obviously it’s easier
to work with a designer who can implement a layout directly in HTML and
CSS.</p>
<p>Rails can be particularly challenging when it comes to integrating
graphic design with code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails uses a hybrid of HTML markup mixed with
Ruby programming code in its <em>view</em> files (depending on the stack you’ve
selected, the view files can use ERB, Haml, or other syntaxes for mixing
HTML and Ruby).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Few designers are comfortable with Ruby code mixed with
HTML so you may end up doing integration yourself.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a skilled graphic designer available to help, you can
use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap</a> or other front-end frameworks
such as <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zurb Foundation</a> to quickly add an
attractive design to your application.</p>
<p>In a later chapter that covers HTML and CSS, you’ll learn about templates and
themes for Bootstrap that provide a beginning point for page design.</p>

<div id="cid40" data-tralics-id="cid40" class="section" data-number="8.5"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid40" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">8.5 </span>Software Development Process</a></h2>
<p>Product planning is the initial phase of a larger software development
process.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can approach this casually, and start coding with curiosity
and ambition, finding your own best way to the end product, by trial and
error.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most hobbyist and student developers need no other approach.</p>
<p>When money or reputation is at stake, casual approaches to software
development are risky.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Compared to other forms of engineering, software
development is peculiarly prone to failure.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As recently as 2003, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0306_perks/perks2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM
stated</a>,
“Most software projects fail.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In fact, the Standish group reports that
over 80% of projects are unsuccessful either because they are over budget, late, missing function, or a combination.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Moreover, 30% of software projects are so poorly executed that they are canceled
before completion.”</p>
<p>Professional software developers, being intelligent and reflexive, and
driven by a desire to become more efficient, or wanting to avoid the
wrath of bosses and clients, frequently look for ways to reduce risk and
improve the software development process.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In recent years they’ve
succeeded in improving the success rate of software engineering, largely
due to the adoption of <em>software development methodologies</em> that improve
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>business process</em></a>
of producing software.</p>
<p>If you’re a hobbyist or casual programmer, you don’t need to learn about
software development methodologies.</p>
<p>If you are going to be held accountable for the success or failure of a
project, you should learn more about software development methodologies.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be interviewing for a job as a programmer, it pays to
recognize some of the names of software development methodologies and
ask whether your employer has adopted a particular approach, especially
if you’d like to work for a company that prides itself on being
well-organized and supportive of staff development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Hiring managers may
say, “we’ve synthesized several methodologies,” which may mean they
don’t have a good answer for the question, or it may mean they are
prepared to thoughtfully discuss the merits of various approaches to
software development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Managers who can discuss software development
methodologies are more likely to be concerned about the welfare of their
team.</p>
<p>Here are some software development methodologies you may hear about,
with some notable characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waterfall process</a> - an old and disparaged approach
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agile software development</a> - an iterative and incremental approach
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scrum</a> - known for “sprints” and daily standup meetings
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extreme Programming (XP)</a> - pair programming and test-driven development
</li></ul>
<p>Agile, Scrum, and XP are all related, and often mixed in practice.</p>
<p>As you mature as a software developer, take time to think about the
process of building software and learn more about software development
methodologies.</p>

<p>There is one prominent software development approach that is important
for product planning.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is called Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), or
sometimes, Behavior-Driven Design.</p>
<p>BDD takes user stories and turns them into detailed scenarios that are
accompanied by tests.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot from a consultant’s web application that shows how a
user story can be extended from a “feature” to include detailed
“scenarios.”</p>
<div class="center figure" id="fig-lowdown-full" data-tralics-id="uid100" data-number="8.2">
<div class="graphics image"><img src="./learn-rails-1_files/learn-rails-lowdown-full.png" alt="images/figures/learn-rails-lowdown-full"></div><div class="caption"><span class="header">Figure 8.2: </span><span class="description">Feature and scenario.
</span></div></div>
<p>Rails developers turn these scenarios into tests using either a software tool
named <a href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cucumber</a> or <a href="http://rspec.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSpec</a> to run automated test suites.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most
developers write scenarios using a simple text editor.</p>
<p>With automated tests, a product owner can determine if developers have
succeeded in implementing the required features.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This process is called
<em>acceptance testing</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Automated tests also make it easy for developers
to determine if the application still works as they add features, fix
bugs, or reorganize code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This process is called <em>regression testing</em>.</p>
<p>On a small project like our tutorial application, you won’t use BDD.
It’s easy enough to manually test the features before you deploy your application.</p>
<p>For an introductory book, BDD is an advanced topic.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But on a project
where money and reputation is at stake, BDD can be very important.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Every
time an application is deployed, there’s a chance that something could
be broken.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Software development is plagued with “fix one thing,
accidentally break another” as code is refactored or improved.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Manual
testing can’t be expected to reveal every bug.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s why automated
testing, providing coverage of every significant user-facing feature, is
the only way to know if you’ve deployed without known bugs.</p>
<p>In Book Two, a “Testing” chapter will introduce you to
the terminology and concepts of automated testing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You won’t have to
worry about testing when we build the tutorial application, but
afterward you’ll learn enough about testing to be prepared for more
advanced tutorials.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Kanban</em></a> is a
method of managing projects that has been adapted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lean
manufacturing</a> for use
in software development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In Japanese, “Kan” means visual, and “ban”
means card or board.</p>
<p>Imagine putting a big whiteboard on your wall and creating columns for a
series of to-do lists.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The columns, called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_lane" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>swimlanes</em></a>, are labelled:
Backlog, Ready, Coding, Testing, Done.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each swimlane contains index
cards that describe a user story or other task.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To plan your work and
track progress, you’ll move the index cards across the board from column
to column.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To stay focused and avoid becoming overwhelmed, you’ll only
pick the most important user stories or tasks from the backlog column
and you’ll limit the number of items in each column to what can be
realistically accomplished in the time available.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s the essence of
kanban as it is used for software development.</p>
<p>See the article on <a href="https://railsapps.github.io/rails-project-management.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails and Project
Management</a>

<p>This is a book for every beginner, so I’ll explain how we use a text

<p>You can develop web applications with Rails on computers running Mac OS
X, Linux, or Microsoft Windows operating systems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most Rails developers
use macOS or Linux because the underlying Unix operating system has
long been the basis for open source programming.</p>
<p>Later in this chapter, I’ll give links to installation instructions for
macOS and Linux.</p>
<p>For Windows users, I have to say, installing Rails on Windows is
frustrating and painful.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Readers and workshop students often tell me
that they’ve given up on learning Rails because installation of Ruby on
Windows is difficult and introduces bugs or creates configuration
issues.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Even when you succeed in getting Rails to run on Windows, you
will encounter gems you cannot install.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For these reasons, I urge you to
use Cloud9, a browser-based development environment, on your Windows
laptop.</p>

computer, try using Cloud9.</p>
<p><a href="https://c9.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud9</a> provides a hosted development environment.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That
means you set up an account and then access a remote computer from your

credit card required to set up an account.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll only be charged if you
add extra computer memory or disk space (which you don’t need for
ordinary Rails development).</p>
<p>The Cloud9 service gives you everything you need for Rails development,
including a Unix shell with Ruby pre-installed, plus a browser-based
file manager and text editor.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Any device that runs a web browser will
give you access to Cloud9, including a tablet or smartphone, though you

<p>Your first challenge in learning Rails is installing Ruby on your
computer.</p>
<p>Frankly, this can be the most difficult step in learning Rails because
no tutorial can sort out the specific configuration of your computer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Get over this hump and everything else becomes easy.</p>
<p>The focus of this book is the background you need to understand Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In Book Two, you’ll build a real-world Rails application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Before you
can build the application, you’ll need to install the latest versions
of the Ruby language and the Rails gem.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can get started now, with
the links provided below, or you can wait until you have started reading Book Two.</p>
<p>You’ll spend at least an hour installing Ruby and Rails, so defer the task
until you have sufficient time at your computer.</p>

</li></ul>
<p>Most people use a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with their computers, tablets, or phones.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As a developer, instead of using the GUI, you’ll get “under the hood” and work directly with the engine that controls your computer, the operating system.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is what makes software programming look intimidating to learners.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You won’t use menus or buttons as you work.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead, you’ll type commands, line by line, into a window that looks like a computer interface from the 1970s.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In fact, the terminal, or console, is a direct legacy of computers that were developed even earlier, in the 1960s.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The terminal continues to be the fundamental tool of software development.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid51" data-tralics-id="cid51" class="section" data-number="11.1"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid51" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">11.1 </span>The Terminal</a></h2>
<p>The Terminal application or console gives us access to the Unix command line, or shell.</p>
<p>We call the command line the
<em>shell</em> because it is the outer layer of the operating system’s internal
mechanisms (which we call the <em>kernel</em>).</p>
<p>On macOS, you can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terminal application</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Experienced
developers often upgrade to the more powerful
<a href="https://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTerm2</a> application but you can start with the installed Terminal application.</p>
<p>Look for the Terminal in the following places:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacOS: <em>Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal</em>
</li>
<li>Linux: <em>Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Terminal</em>
</li>
<li>Windows: <em>Taskbar Start Button &gt; Command Prompt</em>
</li></ul>
<p>On the Mac, search for the macOS Terminal application by pressing the Command-Spacebar combination (which Apple calls “Spotlight Search”) and searching for “Terminal.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The magnifying glass in the upper right corner of your screen will also launch “Spotlight Search.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or look in the <strong>Applications/Utilities/</strong> folder for the Terminal application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll need to click the name of the application to launch the Terminal.</p>
<p>If you are using Linux then you likely know how to find the Terminal.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Look through the menu for your window manager for “Shell” or “Terminal.”</p>
<p>If you have your computer in front of you, launch your terminal application now.</p>
<p>Try out the terminal application by entering a shell command.</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> whoami
</pre></div></div>
<p>Don’t type the <code>$</code> character.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We call it “the prompt.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The <code>$</code> character is a cue that you should
enter a shell command.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is a longtime convention that indicates you
should enter a command in the terminal application or console.</p>
<p>The Unix shell command <code>whoami</code> returns your username.</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> whoami
<span class="go">danielkehoe</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Instead, you might see:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">command not found: $</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>which indicates you typed the <code>$</code> character by mistake.</p>
<p>If you are new to programming, using a text editor and the shell will
seem primitive compared to the complexity and sophistication of
Microsoft Word or Photoshop.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Software developers edit files with simple
text editors and run programs in the shell.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s all we do.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We have to
remember the commands we need (or consult a cheatsheet) because there
are no graphical menus or toolbars.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Yet with nothing more than a text
editor and the command line interface, programmers have created
everything that you use on your computer.</p>

<p>Unix commands seem cryptic at first.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They are a shorthand that’s

<p>Try it out.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Visit the website and enter <code>ls -1p</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s a Unix command
we’ll use often in Book Two.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The site will explain that the command
“lists directory contents, one file per line, with a slash appended to
directories.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Now that you know about explainshell.com, here’s no need

<p>If you watch experienced developers at work, you may see their consoles
are colorful, with lots of information shown in the prompt.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll see
Git status, current directory, and RVM gemset or Ruby version.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Many
developers replace the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bash shell</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Z shell</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh-my-zsh</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You don’t have
to install the Z shell to get a fancy prompt; the
<a href="https://github.com/revans/bash-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bash-it</a> utility is easy to install
and gives you much of the functionality.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A fancy prompt is helpful but

<p>Before you learn about Unix commands, learn how to exit a command line software program.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is the most important Unix skill you’ll need.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you don’t learn it now, you’ll get stuck inside Unix programs and panic when you can’t return to the command line prompt.</p>
<p>If you’re keeping a notebook for things you learn, write this down:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">To EXIT FROM UNIX commands, type:</span>
<span class="go">Control-c</span>

<span class="go">If that doesn't work, try:</span>

<span class="go">Control-z</span>

<span class="go">If nothing works:</span>
<span class="go">CLOSE THE TERMINAL WINDOW</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>To type <code>Control-c</code>, hold down the “Control” key while pressing the <code>c</code> key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>There is no universal command to exit a Unix program.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Any of these exit techniques might work.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> None do harm to your computer, so if you get stuck, try them all.</p>
<p>Software developers don’t usually say, “I’m running a Unix program.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Usually they say, “I’ve launched a Unix process.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As you learn more about Unix, you’ll learn about the difference between <code>Control-c</code>, which “kills a process,” and <code>Control-z</code>, which “suspends a process.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Right now, you don’t need to learn about processes or what it means to kill or suspend them.</p>

<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">command</span> -option argument

<p>The <code>$</code> character is the prompt.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes you’ll see extra information before the prompt:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">My-MacBook:~ danielkehoe$</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>The prompt can be customized to provide useful information, such as the name of the current folder or the current user.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some people change the <code>$</code> character to a different character, such as the <code>&gt;</code> character.</p>
<p>Don’t be confused by a custom prompt and don’t worry about customizing your prompt right now.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Just remember that when you see a <code>$</code> character on the command line, the computer is waiting for you to enter a command.</p>

<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">command</span> -option argument
</pre></div></div>
<p>Each Unix command is a tiny software program that is already installed on your computer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each command does a few simple things, such as list the contents of a folder or create an empty file.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There are dozens of Unix commands but you only need to learn a few to develop a Rails application.</p>
<p>Entering a command at the prompt and pressing “Return” (or “Enter”) will result in either of two things.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The computer will respond “command not found” or it will run the command and return a result to the terminal window (“the console”).</p>
<p>Sometimes a command is not found because it is not a built-in command and it is not installed on your computer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> More often, you’ve made an error in typing the command.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Unix doesn’t like capital letters (“uppercase”) so unless there is a capital letter in a filename, you probably will need to type lowercase characters.</p>

<p>Most Unix commands have a default response.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Many commands have options for different responses if you set an option “flag” or “switch.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You indicate an option with a <code>-</code> character.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most people call that character a hyphen or dash.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You may hear programmers call it the “minus” character.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes an option is set with <code>–</code>, that you might describe as “dash dash” or “minus minus.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s difficult to see on the typeset page of this book, but to get the <code>-</code> character you type the “dash” character once.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In this book, <code>–</code>, which appears as a slightly longer dash, is actually typed as two dashes.</p>
<p>Two options are common among Unix commands: <code>–help</code> and <code>–version</code> (with double dashes).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There are also abbreviated versions: <code>-h</code> and <code>-v</code> (with a single dash).</p>
<p>If you have a terminal window open on your computer, try typing:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> man -v
<span class="go">man, version 1.6c</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>If I was coaching a beginner, I would say, “Type man space minus v.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Don’t forget the space and be sure to type ‘Enter.’”</p>
<p>The computer returns the version number of the current installed <code>man</code> Unix command.</p>
<p>The Unix <code>man</code> command provides online documentation for every Unix command.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Try:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> man man
<span class="go">.</span>
<span class="go">.</span>
<span class="go">.</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>You’ll see the “man pages” that show exactly what to do with the <code>man</code> command.</p>
<p>You can type <code>man</code> followed by the name of a command to see the documentation for the command.</p>
<p>It is nice to know that every Unix command comes with complete instructions for use.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But try reading some man pages and you’ll understand why most developers never look at man pages.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead they use Google to search online for instructions about how to use Unix commands.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Man pages suffer from the worst features of technical documentation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They are complete to the point of obscurity, providing massive detail without highlighting the most common use cases.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’re better off googling for examples of how to use Unix commands.</p>
<p>You’ll be stuck inside the man pages after you enter <code>man man</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Refer to your notes about how to exit a Unix program.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To get out of the <code>man</code> program, type <code>q</code> to quit.</p>

<p>The term “argument” is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener">borrowed from mathematics</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Many Unix commands like a good argument.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is information that will be processed by a Unix command.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Often it is a filename, if the command will operate on a file or output to a file.</p>
<p>For example, we can create a file with the Unix <code>touch</code> command or remove a file with the Unix <code>rm</code> command:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> touch myfile
<span class="gp">$</span> rm myfile

<p>As you learn Unix commands, it is a good idea to write notes for yourself or prepare a personal cheatsheet.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The act of taking notes will help you remember the commands.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Ultimately, the commands will become second nature through sheer repetition as you develop Rails applications.</p>
<p>Here are the Unix commands you will use most often.</p>
<div id="uid117" data-tralics-id="uid117" class="subsection" data-number="11.7.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid117" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">11.7.1 </span>cd</a></h3>
<p>Computers use file systems to control how data is stored and retrieved using s storage system such as a hard drive.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> By separating the data into individual pieces, and giving each piece a name, the information is easily separated and identified.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In offices in the 20th century, documents were grouped together as files and kept in file folders in filing cabinets.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Computers don’t really need to organize information as files but early computer users apparently thought of computer storage as electronic file cabinets.</p>
<p>In Unix, you are always expected to be somewhere in the filing cabinet.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The folders, or directories, are hierarchical, so a root folder contains multiple folders, which each contains many more folders and files.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> One set of nested folders contains the programs and utilities which make up the operating system and system utilities.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Another set of nested folders contain folders for every user who can sign in to use the computer.</p>
<p>Unix systems can have more than one user account.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each user is given a home directory that contains the files needed by any software programs he or she will use.</p>
<p>Unix expects you to always be somewhere in your computer’s file system.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you get confused or lost, you can always return to your home directory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Unix programmers like cryptic shortcuts that use unique keys from the keyboard.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To get to your home directory, you can enter the directory name, which is your user name, or just type the “tilde” or “squiggle” character.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> On most keyboards, it is the uppercase (shift key) character to the left of the numeral 1.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Look at the typeset character <code>~</code> in this book.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It may look like a smudged dash, but if you look closely, you’ll see the squiggle.</p>
<p>Use the <code>cd</code> (change directory) command to go to your home directory:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> ~
</pre></div></div>
<p>The computer will not return a response to the terminal window, but you’ll be positioned in your home directory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That means Unix commands will look for files in your home directory or save files in your home directory unless you specify another location.</p>

<p>The Unix <code>pwd</code> command will show the file path of your current directory.</p>
<p>It is easy to get confused and not be sure where you are.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you feel lost, use the <code>pwd</code> command.</p>

<p>Use the <code>pwd</code> command to figure out where you are.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Then look around with the <code>ls</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>ls</code> command lists the files and folders that are contained in your present working directory.</p>

<p>The response shows a list of files and folders.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Your list will be different.</p>
<p>You can use options for many different lists of files and folders.</p>
<p>For example, you can see a list of files and folders in a single column with <code>ls -1</code>:</p>

<p>You can create a new file with the Unix <code>touch</code> command.</p>
<p>Often it is easier to use a text editor to create and save a new file.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But we’ll use the <code>touch</code> command here to create a file we’ll remove later.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is called the <code>touch</code> command because its intended purpose is update the timestamp on files or folders by “touching” the file or folder.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But the command is also useful for creating new files.</p>
<p>If you haven’t done anything since entering the previous commands, you’ll still be in your <strong>workspace</strong> folder.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But let’s enter a command to move you to the <strong>workspace</strong> folder, just in case you are elsewhere.</p>

<p>We’ve changed the name of the file by adding an underscore character.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The underscore character is commonly used as a substitute for a space between words in a filename.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The Mac operating system can accommodate spaces in filenames but it is bad practice to use spaces in filenames when you work on the command line.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can work with filenames that contain spaces by surrounding the filename with single quote characters (like ‘my file.txt’) but it is inconvenient and most developers simply avoid spaces in filenames.</p>

<p>The mouse belongs to the graphical user interface.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s why it doesn’t work as expected on the command line.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Try entering a command at the prompt:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> rm -rf notmyfolder
</pre></div></div>
<p>If you want to edit the argument and change “notmyfolder” to “myfolder,” you can try clicking with your mouse at the point where you wish to change the text.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But your mouse click will be ignored.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It seems you must use the delete key to back up from end of the line to retype the argument.</p>
<p>But there’s a trick that works on most computers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you press “Option” and click with the mouse, you can edit the command and argument as you would expect.</p>
<p>You can also move around on the command line with Ctrl-a to go to the beginning of a line, Ctrl-e to move to the end of the line, and Ctrl-u to delete everything on the command line.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you can’t remember these shortcuts, don’t worry, you can just use the delete key to move backward and retype when you need to make changes to commands.</p>
</div>

<p>The most useful trick for typing text on the command line is the “up arrow” key, which scrolls through a list of previous commands.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The “down arrow” key scrolls the history of commands in the opposite direction (forward if you’ve moved backward).</p>
<p>With Unix, you only need to type a command once and then you can scroll back to it with the “up arrow” key.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is a real timesaver.</p>

<p>There’s another trick developers use to save time when entering commands and arguments in the terminal.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you are entering a filename, and the file already exists in the present working directory, you can press the “tab” key to autocomplete the filename after typing a few unique letters of the filename.</p>
<p>If there is more than one filename with the same initial letters, the Unix shell will balk and beep.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Pressing tab again will list all the matching filenames.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Continue typing a few more letters until the Unix shell can identify one unique filename and autocomplete.</p>

<p>Our quick introduction to Unix commands taught you about <code>ls</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>rm</code> and other common Unix commands.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If the commands were spelled out as “list,” “copy,” or “remove” they might be easier to remember.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some old-timers say Unix was designed to be efficient on slow teletype terminals.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That may be true, but I believe the abbreviations persist because programmers are lazy and want to type as few characters as possible.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Unix commands may seem obscure but with repetition they will become familiar.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Until then, keep a personal cheatsheet as your reference.</p>
<p>As you learn Rails and develop applications, you’ll gain experience with Unix commands.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> What you’ve learned so far is enough to get started.</p>

<p>You’ll need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text editor</a>
for writing code and editing files.</p>
<p>Word processing programs, such as Microsoft Word, will not work because
they introduce hidden formatting codes into text files.</p>
<p>Programmers’ text editors provide <em>syntax
highlighting</em>, making software code more readable and programmers more
productive.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Simple text editors such as TextEdit for macOS, or
WordPad for Microsoft Windows, provide no syntax highlighting and should
be avoided.</p>

<p>Programmers who come to Rails from other platforms, such as Java or C++,
often ask for recommendations for an IDE, or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrated development environment</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These are software applications that combine a text editor with built-in

<a href="http://www.aptana.org/products/studio3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aptana Studio</a>, or
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Komodo</a> but most Rails
developers use only a text editor and terminal application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You don’t

<p>Old-timers and hardcore technologists use text editors that run in the terminal window:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vim</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emacs</a>
</li></ul>
<p>There is a long-time rivalry between fans of Emacs and vim (and its predecessor vi).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Between the two, vim is more popular.</p>
<p>Emacs and vi are popular among skilled programmers because there’s no need to leave the terminal window to edit a file.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Programmers keep their fingers on the keyboard and don’t need to reach for a mouse to use the text editor.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That makes programmers more productive.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the long run, learning vim or Emacs will make you more productive as well as impressing your colleagues with your technical skill.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Both vim and Emacs are difficult to learn.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re a beginner, don’t attempt to learn vim or Emacs if you’re short on time.</p>
<p>Most beginners will use a text editor with a graphical user interface (GUI).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’re likely to encounter one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atom</a>

<p>Carefully follow the instructions for installing your text editor.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Installation is like any other desktop application; however, there is an unusual and important final step.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Developers want to launch a text editor and open a file for editing by typing a command in the terminal window.</p>
<p>If you’ve installed Atom, click the “Install shell commands” item under the “Atom” menu to enable the <code>atom</code> command.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you do so, you can open a file in Atom from the command line:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> atom myfile.txt

<p>Sublime Text has a similar configuration option for the Mac, though it takes more fiddling to set up.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sublime Text documentation</a> explains how.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you need more help, see Olivier Lacan’s blog post, <a href="http://olivierlacan.com/posts/launch-sublime-text-3-from-the-command-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Launch Sublime Text 3 from the Command Line</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> After you’ve completed the configuration, you can open a file in Sublime Text from the command line:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> subl myfile.txt
</pre></div></div>
<p>Opening a file from the command line is a big win for productivity.</p>
<p>It’s even more useful to open an entire folder from the command line.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the “Terminal Unix” chapter, you learned that Unix has a “dot file” that represents the present working directory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To open an entire folder in Atom, try:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> atom .
</pre></div></div>
<p>The text editor window will display a “tree view” of files and folders in a window pane.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Click on any file to open it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is very convenient to see an entire project at a glance in your text editor.</p>

<p>Experienced Rails developers debate whether beginners should study Ruby before learning Rails.</p>
<p>Most experienced Rails developers recommend that you study Ruby before attempting to learn Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most code camps teach a week or two of Ruby before introducing web development with Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Given that Rails is based on the Ruby programming language, it seems logical to teach Ruby as a prerequisite to learning Rails.</p>
<p>There are several flaws with this approach.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Every “learn Ruby” book, video, or online course teaches Ruby with a series of classroom exercises.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A concept is introduced, followed by examples, and then a programming puzzle or quiz, much like the way arithmetic was taught to children in the 1950s.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you are academically gifted, you can learn the basics of Ruby with this approach.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But many people become frustrated and don’t learn well this way.</p>
<p>Though experienced Rails developers think a beginner should learn Ruby this way, many actually knew other programming languages already, and learned Ruby by skimming a language reference to notice differences, and googled for help when they needed to figure out how to write something in Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They improved their skills by reading blogs or watching screencasts such as Avdi Grimm’s <a href="http://www.rubytapas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby Tapas</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But mostly they learned Ruby by working on real-world problems that required skill with Ruby.</p>
<p>The fact is, though you can get oriented to the basics of Ruby in a week, it takes a year or more of regular use of the language to gain proficiency.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rubyists develop their skill with Ruby over years, not weeks.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s true of most general purpose programming languages.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Learning Ruby is a lifelong education program, not a short course.</p>
<p>Does that mean you’ll never learn Rails?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> On the contrary.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Despite what experienced Rails developers will say, you can begin building Rails applications without developing Ruby proficiency.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails is largely a DSL, or <em>domain specific language</em>, with its own keywords and directives built using Ruby, and following the Ruby language syntax.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Many developers started learning Rails by following tutorials to build Rails applications without first studying Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You will pick it up as you go along.</p>
<p>Before my colleagues lambast me for leading newbies astray, let me say that trying to learn Rails without making an effort to learn Ruby is inefficient and counter productive.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As you follow a Rails tutorial, make a parallel effort to learn Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> One will support the other.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> By building real applications with Ruby and Rails, and making an effort to learn more about Ruby at the same time, you’ll be motivated to learn Ruby and you’ll retain more knowledge of Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And you’ll be a better Rails developer.</p>

<p>In this book series, I’ve taken a realistic approach.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In Book Two, you will get started building a real-world Rails application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You will gain familiarity with the syntax of the Ruby language by studying the code that is needed to build the application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> After you’ve been exposed to real-world Rails code, you’ll read a short chapter to learn about the basic features of the Ruby language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The goal of the chapter is to develop Ruby language literacy.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> With a grounding in real-world Rails code, and a short introduction to the Ruby language, you’ll have a solid basis to develop your Ruby knowledge plus motivation to do so.</p>
<p>What you need, more than anything, when you start working with Rails, is reading knowledge of Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> With a reading knowledge of Ruby you’ll avoid feeling overwhelmed or lost when you encounter code examples or work through a tutorial.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Later, as you tackle complex projects and write original code, you’ll need to know enough of the Ruby language to implement the features you need.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But as a student, you’ll be following tutorials that give you all the Ruby you need.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Your job is to recognize the language keywords and use the correct syntax when you type Ruby code in your text editor.</p>
<p>Your hardest challenge will be to learn the names of the structures you see in code examples.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is why it is helpful to work your way through a short introduction to Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll need to be able to recognize when you are looking at an array or a hash.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You should recognize when you are looking at an iterator or the Ruby block syntax.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Eventually, you’ll recognize more exotic Ruby formulations such as the lambda.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is okay if you can’t write a lambda function or even know when to use one; many Rails developers start work before learning Ruby thoroughly.</p>
<p>By all means, if you love the precision and order of programming languages, dive into the study of Ruby from the beginning.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s good advice, just not for everyone.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’ve got the time
and inclination, get started with these recommended books and videos before you read Book Two.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you can, study them at the same time you work on the project in Book Two.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At the very least, look at these resources after you finish Book Two and before you start another tutorial.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll be glad you did.</p>

overcome the challenges you’ll face when you are done reading tutorials.</p>
<p>What comes next partly depends on your goals.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You may be eager to launch
a startup, you may want a job as a developer, or you may have a project
to tackle at work or in your spare time.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Whatever you choose to do,
you’ll face the challenge of building an application without
instructions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here I’ll give you ideas about overcoming that challenge.</p>

<div id="cid67" data-tralics-id="cid67" class="section" data-number="14.1"><h2><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#cid67" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">14.1 </span>Facing the Gap</a></h2>
<p>There’s a name for the obstacle that lies in wait for beginners who
teach themselves to code by following a tutorial.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I call it the
“tutorial gap.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s the yawning chasm you face when it is time to build
a custom application of your own.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Even though you’ve just built and
deployed a working application, the moment you are without instructions,
the chasm will open wide.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll feel it most acutely when you realize
you don’t know where to start.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Should you search for a gem?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Should you
start by building a view, a model, or a controller?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Should you do
test-first development and write a test?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> What should you test if you
don’t know where to start?</p>
<p>A similar problem lies in wait for beginners the first day on the job.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll hear it called the “junior gap.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The term refers to the chasm
between the time a developer is hired and becomes a “junior dev.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A
“junior dev” is a team member who is more-or-less self-sufficient,
learning new skills without being a burden for other developers, and
able to contribute to a company at a level that increases team
productivity.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Whether self-taught, hired after graduation from a
university, or from a 9 or 12 week code camp, new staff members seldom
have the skills to be fully productive members of a team.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Your success
at a new job depends on how quickly you overcome the junior gap.</p>
<p>The “tutorial gap” and the “junior gap” are versions of the same chasm.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll cross the chasm each time you build an application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The more
applications you build, the narrower the chasm becomes, and the less
help you need, until you’ve crossed the chasm so many times that panic
is replaced by delight when someone asks you to implement something
you’ve never encountered before.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s the point when you’ve become a
self-sufficient and productive developer.</p>
<p>If you assume that becoming a successful developer depends on acquiring
technical skills, the chasm may thwart you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The chasm cannot be crossed
with technical knowledge, no matter how much you learn about Ruby,
Rails, JavaScript or any other technology.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Crossing the chasm requires
“soft skills,” including cultivating your own problem-solving abilities,
and realizing that software development is fundamentally a social
activity.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I’m going to describe two ways to cross the chasm.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First, I’ll give you a technique to jump start work on a custom
application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s a strategy that will enhance your problem-solving
abilities.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> After that I’ll suggest how to get help from a mentor,
focusing on the social practice that is at the heart of software
development.</p>

<p>When you start work on a custom application, you’re like a writer who
has to write an essay and faces a blank screen.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’ve been taught to
write an essay, you probably learned to make an outline and start with a
topic sentence or introductory statement.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Not every writer starts that
way, but it’s a strategy to get started.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can use a similar strategy
to get started with custom application development.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here’s a process you
can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask: Why will someone want to use your application?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Write a product description.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Ask: What will a visitor first see and do?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Write a user story for the home page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>If you like to think visually, create wireframes for some of the important features.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Create user stories for some of the important features.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Generate a starter application with <code>rails new</code> or <a href="http://www.railscomposer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails Composer</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Pick any user story.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Make a static page using HTML to mock up what the user will see.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Write a feature test to verify the content on your static page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is your first code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Create a model.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Use the model to set a variable containing some string from the static page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Create a controller.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Give it the same name as the model.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Create a route for the controller.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Replace the static page with a dynamic page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Use the controller to set an instance variable and render a view.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Does your feature test still pass?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Modify your feature test if necessary.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Ask: How will data displayed on the page get into the model?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> From a third-party API? A user-submitted form?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Replace the hard-coded string in the model with dynamic data obtained from a user or an API.
</li>
<li>Check your feature test.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Does it still pass?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Do you need to change the test to use the model?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Ask: Have you implemented the user story?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Do you need to revise the user story?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Commit your work to Git.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Then throw it away if you’re not satisfied.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can always “do over” later.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Ask: Is there another user story you can implement?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Get started again.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>You may have to repeat this process many times before you have something
you can keep.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each time, you will discover what you don’t know.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Perhaps
you haven’t expressed a user story well and you need to rethink your
feature.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or you’ve reached the limit of your technical knowledge and you
need to do some research and further study.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each time you repeat this
process you are practicing crossing the chasm.</p>
<p>Not every writer starts an essay the same way, and not every developer
will use the strategy detailed above.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’ve ever faced writers’
block, you may have heard this advice from teachers: Write something,
anything, just to get started.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s the same with software code: Just
begin, anywhere.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you follow the strategy described above, you’ll have
a place to get started.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is a process you can repeat when you start
any application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you need more help, see the book <a href="https://www.justinweiss.com/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practicing Rails</a> by Justin Weiss, which

<p>Let’s consider the social aspect of software development.</p>
<p>If you work on your own, trying to master the art of software
development, it will take you a very long time, you’ll need
extraordinary patience and tenacity, and you won’t become a very good
software developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To accelerate the process, and improve your skill,
you must reach out to others.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re shy and introverted, this will
be hard; if you’re bossy or reluctant to reveal your shortcomings, it
may also be difficult.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, you must make the effort if you want to
cross the chasm.</p>
<p>Software development often looks like a solo activity but it is not.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Developers talk to users to improve the user interface and product
features.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Open source libraries, whether gems or full frameworks like
Rails, are developed collaboratively.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Code reviews are an opportunity to
ask others to help you improve your implementation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Pairing is an
intense and effective way to write better code and share knowledge.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll learn more, and faster, from both experienced developers and
inexperienced peers, when you work with others.</p>

<p>It is important to have a strategy to get started on your own, as
described above.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You must make an initial effort, even if picking
yourself up by your bootstraps doesn’t get you very far.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> No one,
particularly software developers, wants to help someone who can’t show
they’ve made a best effort on their own.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You may surprise yourself when
you make an initial effort; you’ll find out what you know and identify
what you need to learn.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Start a list of topics you need to research or
questions you need to answer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Do research.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If no clear answer emerges,
list the possibilities and show them to someone else.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Even if you think
you’ve found the answer on Stack Overflow or a blog, show someone your
initial problem and the solution you’ve found.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Find out if your
colleague agrees or has another perspective.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Showing someone your
research shows you’ve made an effort and it will make it easier to ask
for help when research doesn’t provide a solution.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (Refer to the “Get
Help When You Need It” chapter if you’re not sure where to do research.)</p>

<p>Don’t be shy about asking for help.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’ve made a best effort to
solve a problem on your own, and you’re willing to help others in the
future, you’ll get all the help you need, and more.</p>
<p>There’s an unwritten rule of the open source movement.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It applies
whenever you ask a stranger for help, whether opening an issue on GitHub
or asking for help with a project.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You <em>are not entitled to
anything</em>, whether its software code, a bug fix, or just help,
<em>if you’re only consuming</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Open source is free for the taking
but you’re not welcome if you’re a mooch.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Luckily for all of us,
<em>causality rules do not apply</em> (or at least there’s no temporal
causality).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That means, if you contribute something in the future, help
will be forthcoming, sometimes more profusely than you’ve asked for.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You
must contribute in kind, of course.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you offer to pay money to have a
bug fixed, you’re violating the spirit of open source, and you can
expect either grumpiness, a hefty consulting fee, or both.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you
indicate you’re willing to help with documentation or code, you’ll be
welcomed even if you’re currently incapable of contributing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This
applies in an interesting way to beginners.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you show you’ve tried to
solve a problem on your own, and ask for help, many developers will help
without any compensation other than the conviction that someday you’ll
help someone in a similar situation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Software development relies on a

<p>Now that you’ve given some thought to the social aspect of software
development, let’s consider where to go for help.</p>
<p>When career advisors talk about closing the junior gap, they’ll often
point to the importance of mentorship as the key element in becoming a
skilled software developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s just as important when you’re
developing software for a startup or a personal project.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Mentorship will
help you cross the chasm.</p>
<p>You may ask, how can I find a mentor?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In your mind’s eye, you may be
imagining the mentor that will help you become a skilled Rails
developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> He or she is a few years older than yourself, has a great job
leading a team at a successful startup, probably contributes to several
well-known open source gems, and takes a break every Saturday for a few
hours to teach you how to code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sorry, that is not likely to happen.</p>
<p>The mentors who will help you will not fit the picture of a wise sage or
crone, no more than Prince Charming or Princess Buttercup will ever be
anyone’s spouse.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In most situations, the mentorship relationship will be
unacknowledged.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The seeds of mentorship lie in any interaction where you
ask for help and receive guidance.</p>
<p>Mentorship is a relationship you must cultivate, much like friendship.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And, like friendship, you will seldom ever ask someone to be your
mentor.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most people would balk at the awkwardness, either because they
don’t see themselves as qualified, or because it suggests an open-ended
commitment and responsibility that is intrusive.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Like making new
friends, it is your job to seek out mentoring moments, ensure the
experience is mutually rewarding, and suggest the possibility of
repeating the experience.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Mentorship is a relationship built from a
series of successful mentoring interactions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Repeat the interactions and
you have mentorship.</p>

<p>In the chapter “Get Help When You Need It,” you learned where to look
for help.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Let’s consider where you can look for opportunities to
experience mentorship moments.</p>
<div id="uid191" data-tralics-id="uid191" class="subsection" data-number="14.5.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid191" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">14.5.1 </span>Online</a></h3>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a>, or
<a href="https://www.quora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quora</a>, the answers will be most useful when you
focus narrowly on a specific question.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Mentorship comes from open-ended
interaction, when a conversation can move in unanticipated directions,
so most online interactions seldom turn into mentorship moments.</p>
<p>Online interactions may help you find people who can coach you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Clicking
on a user’s name on a site such as Stack Overflow, Reddit, or Quora will
show you a user’s profile.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When someone is helpful or knowledgeable,
check if they show their geographic location in their profile.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If they
don’t, perhaps they’ve provided a link to their website or Twitter
account.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If not, you may be able to send a private message.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Reach out
and ask where they are located, if they have time to meet to answer more
questions, or can suggest anyone in your city who might be helpful.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It
is worth checking to see if someone is local even though most people
online are not nearby.</p>

<p>GitHub is a special case.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Interactions on GitHub are at the core of the
Rails community.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s where open source software gets built.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Collaboration on GitHub leads to mentorship, friendships, and business
partnerships.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s why it is so important to build a credible GitHub
profile by uploading the projects you build while learning, to show that
you are working steadily at becoming a better programmer.</p>
<p>When you look at a repository on GitHub, look at the account of the
person who maintains the project.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Look at the commits and the issues.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Click through to the profiles of the people who’ve made the commits or
commented on the issues.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Experienced developers often show their
location in their profile and provide their email address.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you find
someone in your city, make contact.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Of course, don’t ask a stranger
point-blank to be a mentor!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Tell them about your experience and what
interests you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Ask where you can meet developers locally.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You may learn
about a meetup or user group meeting.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If your contact is helpful, you
may have an opportunity to meet for coffee.</p>

<p>Meetups are a prime place to cultivate in-person mentorship moments.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> All
large metro areas have active meetups for web developers, Rails
developers, programmers, or startup entrepreneurs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re in a rural
area, make the drive once a month to the big city to connect with the
community.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To find the meetups, search
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meetup.com</a> or google “ruby rails (my city)”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re near a university campus, check for activity on the campus.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If
you’re in a tech hub such as San Francisco, there’s a meetup almost
every night of the week.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Smaller cities have relevant meetups monthly.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you can’t find a meetup, start one!</p>
<p>When you visit a meetup, remember that mentorship can be hidden in
anyone.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Like any public event, you’ll meet people who are flakey,
bigoted, garrulous, prone to halitosis or innumerable personality
quirks, as well as a minority who are fascinating and obviously
knowledgeable.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Don’t dismiss anyone.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll find mentorship moments

<p>You may be surprised that workshops and classes are not the ideal place
to find a mentor.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Obviously, given a good instructor and a relevant
curriculum, a workshop or class is a great place to learn.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, it
is very unlikely that a teacher will become an ongoing mentor.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The
instructor’s goal is to share knowledge with a group of people, so any
focus on you as an individual has to be limited.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Furthermore, the
instructor is probably not available outside of the class or on an
ongoing basis.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Don’t sign up for a class hoping the instructor will
become your mentor.</p>
<p>However, a workshop or class is an ideal place to connect with peers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There is no other place where you’ll easily find other people who want
to learn the same things as you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When I teach, I’m surprised how often
people come to a class expecting their education will end as soon as the
class is over.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you take a class, seize the opportunity to make one
new friend who will be your study partner after the class ends.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Better
yet, organize a study group to continue after the class is over.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you
have only one new study partner, he or she can flake out.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead, get
together with three or four other learners once a week.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Support each
other, share your excitement, and invite mentors to come speak to your
study group.</p>
<p>Peer learning has much in common with mentorship.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The leading code camps
recognize that collaborative problem-solving skills are as important as
technical skills.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When students team up to work through exercises or
build applications, there’s a natural give-and-take as each takes turns
making discoveries and sharing knowledge.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You don’t have to enroll in
code camp to be part of a peer learning environment; you can create it
yourself in a study group.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This isn’t a relationship of mentorship, but
it is an opportunity to experience mentorship moments.</p>

<p>You are most likely to find a commitment to mentorship on the job.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If
you’ve been hired to work as a Rails developer, at a company with Rails
developers on the team, you’re in an ideal environment to learn.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Not
everyone has the skills to be a good mentor and you may struggle if you
are stuck with a senior developer who is a know-it-all or assumes you
know more than you do.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Still, you have immediate access to developers
with knowledge and the company has every reason to encourage you to
learn.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Unless the company has an explicit program to assign coaches to
new hires, you will probably not call someone your mentor.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead,
recognize that you can cultivate mentorship moments by asking for
guidance beyond the immediate assignment.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In a stressful environment
where your team is delivering code against deadlines, not everyone may
be able to devote time to teaching.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You should seek mentorship moments
where you can.</p>
<p>Some companies are committed to building a culture of mentorship.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When
you are looking for a job, make it your priority to seek a job offer
from companies where you will find mentors.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For a first job as a
developer, the opportunity to learn on the job is far more valuable than
any other benefits.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you interview, ask if the company encourages
pair programming.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Ask if you will have time to work on a pet project to
learn new skills, and if it will be acceptable to ask your teammates to
answer questions or provide a code review for your pet project.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Ask if
the company encourages team presentations about new technologies.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Ask if
anyone from the company volunteers to teach at workshops or gives
presentations at meetups or conferences.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some hiring managers will be
proud to describe the company’s commitment to developer education.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If
they’re not, it’s a red flag that the company may not be a good fit for
you.</p>
<p>Small startups are not a good place to look for mentorship, if the
runway is short and the founders are trying to launch before funding
runs out.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Companies that have closed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_A_round" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A
round</a> (the first release
of stock to venture capital firms and other private equity investors)
will still be tightly focused on getting a product to market, with no
time to coach new hires.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As a company takes additional rounds of
investment, beyond the Series B round, the company will have grown
beyond an initial two or three engineers and may recognize the value of
hiring and coaching inexperienced developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To some companies,
mentorship is part of a strategy to develop their technical depth.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These
are the companies that are ideal for new developers.</p>

<p>If your goal is to start a career as a Rails developer, your objective
should be to find a job at company that is committed to mentorship.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll need to learn more than what is offered in this book and the next, but you can
continue learning while you “go social” to cultivate mentorship moments
and meet people who can introduce you to companies that are hiring Rails
developers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Going to meetups, collaborating on code, and participating
in a study group will help you find mentors and help you find a job.</p>
<p>If you are eager to launch a startup, or plan to work on a personal
project, your next step will be different.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Let’s consider what you
should do after finishing this book if you’re an entrepreneur,
developing a lifestyle business, or working on a personal “side
project.”</p>
<div id="uid196" data-tralics-id="uid196" class="subsection" data-number="14.6.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid196" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">14.6.1 </span>Entrepreneurs</a></h3>
<p>If you want to launch a startup, stop and ask yourself what your
priorities should be.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Startup success depends on asking yourself every
day, “What is the most important task I need to accomplish today?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Chances are, it is not learning to code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Working through my books,
you’ll learn enough to work with a skilled developer, whether a cofounder, an
employee, or contractors.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Your most important task is to determine the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product/market fit</a>
for your business idea.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You must develop a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minimum Viable
Product</a> (MVP) and
start the process of acquiring customers who can tell you if your
product has value.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Anything else defers the day of judgment when real
customers will tell you whether they are willing to spend money on your
product.</p>
<p>If you are pursuing your own business vision, you’ll only delay judgment
day if your priority is to learn Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you haven’t already, start
looking for a technical cofounder or people you can hire (if you have
your own funds).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Angel investors and venture capitalists are reluctant
to fund a solo founder, even when an entrepreneur is highly skilled
technically.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Investors place more importance on the ability and track
record of the team than on a business idea; obviously, a skilled team is
a better investment risk than a solo founder who just started learning
Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In today’s investment climate, you won’t be seeking investment if
you don’t yet have an MVP and customer traction.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But you should start
recruiting your team.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The good news is that you’ve learned enough about
web development to have credibility when approaching a potential
technical cofounder.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Among developers, there is no one more ridiculed
than the non-technical founder who makes no effort to learn to code and
expects someone else to do all the technical work.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’re not
that guy or girl.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You <em>could</em> build your web application yourself, given
enough time.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But in the best interests of your business, you should look
for a partner who will be your technical mentor, guide, and helpmate as
you become a better coder and build out your MVP.</p>
<p>You can seek a technical cofounder in the same way you seek mentorship
moments.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Your agenda will be larger; anyone who is a mentor or peer may
be a potential business partner.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Look for help to improve your technical
proficiency.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As you build a personal relationship with a mentor or peer,
you may have an opportunity to introduce someone to your business
vision.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is very unlikely you can build a business on your own, so
start looking for a partner while you continue to learn to code and
develop your MVP.</p>
<p>You won’t be having meetings with potential partners every day.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> On days
when you are not looking for a partner, work on the user stories that
will define the requirements for your MVP. You don’t need anything more
than you’ve learned in this book to develop your user stories and plan
your product.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Work on wireframes and show your ideas to anyone who will
listen.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Take a break from product planning to work on your coding
skills.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Try tackling one or two user stories and see if you can
implement a basic feature you need for your MVP. There’s no better way
to learn to code than building the product that you need for your
business, especially if you get help and feedback along the way.</p>

<div id="uid197" data-tralics-id="uid197" class="subsection" data-number="14.6.2"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid197" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">14.6.2 </span>Lifestyle Businesses and Personal Projects</a></h3>
<p>Don’t let anyone discourage you if you have an idea for a web
application that will supplement your earnings from a job, or even let
you quit your job to enjoy a “lifestyle.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The investment community
disdains lifestyle businesses that have limited “upside” (the revenue
growth that rewards investors).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Personally, I think lifestyle businesses
are great.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Without the pressure from investors, and with income from an
existing job, you can take your time to learn to code, enjoying the
process of learning application development with your goal in mind.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It
is still worthwhile to seek out a mentor, but you can continue to pursue
learning on your own with all the resources we list in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Personal projects can become lifestyle businesses when they begin to
generate revenue.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Of course, there are many personal projects that are
not intended to be moneymakers, for example, a web application for a
faith group or a charity, or just a side project that helps you learn to
code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Again, seek mentorship moments, or work in a group that learns
together, and you’ll develop your skills faster.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Play around with user
stories and wireframes to see if it helps you organize your project.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Try
writing feature tests.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You may not need to write tests for a personal
project but you may discover a feeling of competence and confidence that
goes with testing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> With a personal project, the journey is the reward.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Indulge in the luxury of learning for its own sake and focus on the
satisfaction of seeing applications run that you’ve built with
technologies that are new to you.</p>

<p>If you want to become a skilled Rails developer, nothing is more
important than building applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As you’ll see in the next chapter,
there is so much to learn about web application development that you can
(and likely will) continue to learn until the web goes dark.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Don’t try
to learn it all.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Start building applications now.</p>
<p>Building applications puts everything you learn in practical context.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The features you want to build will set the priorities for what you
learn next.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you want users to sign in to an application, you’ll learn
about authentication.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you want want to show stock prices or sports
scores, you’ll learn about JavaScript and charts.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s no better way
to learn than by building.</p>
<p>Build simple applications at first, with only one small feature.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Take
them all the way from user stories to deployment.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Use <a href="http://www.railscomposer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails
Composer</a> if you want to get started fast
so you can focus on your custom features.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Commit your projects to your
GitHub account, no matter how trivial or broken.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Putting your projects
on GitHub will show that are working hard and gaining experience.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If
you’re going on job interviews, employers probably won’t have time to
look at your GitHub account, but you’ll gain points in a job interview
if you can point to a GitHub repository to show something you’ve built,
or when you answer a question like, “What is the hardest problem you’ve
had to solve?”</p>
<p>Some beginners set a goal, such as building one new application every
week.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s a great plan.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When your applications get more complex, they
will make take more than a week to build, but keep on building.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you
don’t have any ideas for what to build, ask for ideas on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a> or
<a href="https://www.quora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quora</a> and the indefatigable commenters will
gladly answer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At a minimum, you should build (and thoroughly
understand) each of the starter applications you can build with <a href="http://www.railscomposer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails
Composer</a>.</p>
<p>With every application you build, the chasm of the “tutorial gap” will
narrow and you will broaden your ability to tackle unfamiliar problems
and challenges.</p>

<div id="uid216" data-tralics-id="uid216" class="subsection" data-number="15.1.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid216" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">15.1.1 </span>Databases</a></h3>
<p>Book Two will explain how to create a model, a software object that represents
data in a database.</p>
<p>When you create a model, you create an object that handles data only for
the brief life of the request-response cycle, when it is active in a
computer’s working memory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll want data to persist beyond the brief
request-response cycle, after objects disappear from working memory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails does not include a built-in database.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It offers the flexibility of
using several different industrial-grade database systems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Relational
database management systems such as <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQLite</a>,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a>,
<a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySQL</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oracle</a> all use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Structured Query Language</a> (SQL) as
an interface to store and retrieve data.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These databases run separately
from a web application, requiring their own database servers.</p>
<p>Rails provides a component, named <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Active Record</a>, that
connects to these database servers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Active Record is a framework for
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), connecting application models to
database tables in a relational database management system (DBMS).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Active Record makes it possible to save model data as a record in an
external database, preserving complex relationships among the data.</p>
<p>Application development would be easy if we could just use spreadsheets
to save our data.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, some data, such as a document, is too large
to fit in the columns and rows of a spreadsheet.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> More significantly,
database management systems are designed to accommodate relationships
among the data.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s why they are called relational database
management systems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, an ecommerce application might have a
Customer model and an Order model.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Active Record allows developers to
use the Rails API to describe associations among models and interact
with a database.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, you can make sure that an order is not
created unless it is associated with a customer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Additionally, Active
Record provides a query interface.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can use the query interface to
find all orders associated with a particular customer.</p>

<p>Most web applications need a way for users to sign in, permitting access
to some features of the application only for signed-in users.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The
popular gem <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devise</a> is used to
add authentication for users who register with an email address and
password.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OmniAuth</a> is a gem
for authentication using a service such as Facebook, Twitter, or GitHub.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most Rails developers will use these gems because they are robust and
well-tested.</p>
<p>To understand how authentication works, you’ll need to learn about
<em>sessions</em> in a web application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The web, as originally built, was
<em>stateless</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A server simply responded to a request by delivering
a file.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To enable ecommerce applications,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cookies</a> were adopted in 1997
as a way to preserve state.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each time the browser makes a request, it
will send a cookie.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A web application will check the value of the cookie
and, if the value remains the same, the application will recognize the
requests as a sequence of actions or a <em>session</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A session
begins with the first request from a browser to a web application and
continues until the browser is closed.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Cookie-based sessions give us a
way to manage data through multiple browser requests.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails does all the
work of setting up an encrypted, tamperproof session.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The data we most
often want to persist throughout a session is an object that represents
the user.</p>

<p>We use authentication to verify a user’s registered identity, so we know
the person signing in is the same person who signed up earlier.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We use
<em>authorization</em> to limit access to pages of a web application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Authorization is typically restricted by role, so users are assigned
roles with differing access privileges.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the simplest implementation,
we check if a user has a specific role (such as administrator) and
either allow access or redirect with an “Access Denied” message.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Roles
are attributes associated with a user account, and often implemented in
a User model.</p>
<p>There are no standard conventions for implementing roles and
authorization in Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Developers often implement roles from scratch
and use gems such as <a href="https://github.com/elabs/pundit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pundit</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CanCanCan</a> to implement

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AJAX</a> techniques.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For
more sophisticated web applications, such as a single-page application
(SPA) that loads in the browser as a single web page and offers a fluid
user experience similar to a desktop application, you’ll need to learn
to use a JavaScript framework such as <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ember.js</a>,
<a href="http://www.angularjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://reactjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a>, or

<p>There is much more to learn before you gain full proficiency as a Rails

<p>The graphic above is from a blog post, <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/blog/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is Why Learning Rails is
Hard</a>,
by Brook Riggio of the <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code Fellows</a> code
camp in Seattle.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can <a href="https://dgosxlrnzhofi.cloudfront.net/custom_page_images/production/64/page_images/Rails_Competencies.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see the graphic in
detail</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The first time I saw it, I felt despair.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is a mind map of all the
topics a skilled developer should know.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The branches on the right side
are topics that are specific to Rails, as well as general skills
required of a Rails developer, such as Git, the Ruby language, and
software engineering competencies.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The branches on the left are general
areas of knowledge that would be understood by any web developer, such
as the Unix command line, web fundamentals, deployment, testing, and
SQL. Brook Riggio says, “If this looks intimidating to you, you’re not
alone….<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Learning Rails is hard because there are many independent
concepts to learn.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I recommend you spend half an hour each day googling
each topic listed on Brook Riggio’s map.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In three months, you’ll have a
“big picture” of the knowledge areas that are important to a Rails
developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can’t learn everything at once, so dive further into the
topics that interest you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As you tackle new projects, you’ll learn more,
and you’ll add depth to your understanding of each topic on the map.</p>

<p>Brook Riggio’s map gives you a list of topics for learning.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But it is
helpful to tackle the topics in a sequence that makes sense.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll also
need recommendations for the best learning materials.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For a curriculum
that organizes the topics you need to become a web developer, I
recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Odin Project</a>
</li></ul>
<p>It is a unique community-driven curriculum, organized by Erik Trautman,
the founder of <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viking Code School</a>,
that gives you a roadmap of what to learn, and where to learn it.</p>

<p>What’s your preferred learning mode?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Books, classrooms, videos, online
courses?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I guess you’re comfortable with books, so I’ll recommend the
best ones for further study.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But first let’s consider other modes of
learning.</p>
<div id="uid240" data-tralics-id="uid240" class="subsection" data-number="15.2.1"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid240" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">15.2.1 </span>Code Camps</a></h3>
<p>Starting in New York City with <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General
Assembly</a> in 2011, and <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev
Bootcamp</a> in San Francisco in 2012, the market
for developer education has been booming.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Right now, in San Francisco,
there are a dozen organizations offering immersive code camps, and
dozens more in large cities worldwide.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These organizations offer eight-
to twelve-week courses, priced around $10,000 to $12,000 USD. For a
list of code camps, see these websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Course Report</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://schools.techendo.com/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techendo Reviews</a>
</li></ul>
<p>Code camps are a great way to become a developer, if you can afford the
cost, and intend to recover the cost by finding a high-paying job as a
developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The best code camps create an environment of peer-based
learning, where you pair with other students to solve technical problems
and build applications, just as you would in the workplace.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Code camps
also provide relentless pressure to learn, from teachers and peers, but
primarily from yourself.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The quality and depth of technical knowledge
you’ll acquire varies greatly depending on the code camp curriculum and
the individual instructors they’ve hired.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> All code camps provide the
motivation and social context for accelerated learning, delivering
self-confidence that comes from the encouragement and feedback of
teachers and peers.</p>
<p>If you don’t have money to pay for code camp, all is not lost.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can
teach yourself Rails with books and, with effort, you’ll be good enough
to start a web-based business or look for a job.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I recommend that you
build your self-confidence by developing applications on your own.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And
certainly, find other learners and study together.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most Rails developers
are self-taught, at least within the domain of web application
development, so code camps or university programs are wonderful, if you
can afford the cost, but not essential.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid244" data-tralics-id="uid244" class="subsection" data-number="15.2.2"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid244" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">15.2.2 </span>Other Classrooms</a></h3>
<p>It’s unusual to find a university or community college that offers
classes in web development with Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the US, university computer
science programs focus on analytical reasoning and the conceptual
underpinnings required for advanced research in the field.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some
community colleges teach web development but it is difficult for the
schools to find experienced Rails instructors, especially given the
disparity in salaries between teaching and software engineering.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, universities or community colleges are good places to meet
other students and form a study group, to provide social support for
learning.</p>
<p>Classes taught in the community, often free or low-cost, are
surprisingly good places to learn.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Teachers and organizers are highly
motivated and may be experienced Rails developers giving back to the
community.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Community-based classes or workshops are often poorly
publicized, so you’ll have to search hard for these courses.</p>
<p>Women have a good chance of finding peer organizations that teach
programming and web development with Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Start by looking at the
course schedules for these organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://railsgirls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails Girls</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://railsbridge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RailsBridge</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Girl Develop It</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women Who Code</a>
</li></ul>
<p>These organizations only offer introductory classes, so you’ll have to
study on your own for deeper knowledge.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Short courses such as weekend
workshops are valuable because you can find other students who want to
start a study group.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid249" data-tralics-id="uid249" class="subsection" data-number="15.2.3"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid249" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">15.2.3 </span>Online Courses</a></h3>
<p>It’s no longer necessary to go to a classroom to go to school.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Online
courses range from online code camps that provide videos and one-on-one
coaching, to websites that offer a selection of pre-recorded videos
packaged as a course, to MOOCs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive open online
courses</a>)
offered by consortiums of universities.</p>
<p>Chasing the runaway success of classroom-based code camps, you’ll find a
number of companies that offer code schools delivered online.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here are a
few that combine videos with personal coaching:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flatironschool.com/campuses/online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flatiron School Online Campus</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bloc.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloc.io</a>

</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viking Code School</a>
</li></ul>
<p>The online code schools provide some of the benefits, specifically
curriculum and coaching, of the classroom-based code camps, at a
fraction of the cost.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Videos, homework projects, and online mentors
can’t reproduce the intense peer-based learning of the classroom code
camps.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But you don’t have to quit your job or move to a another city.</p>
<p>MOOCs provide university-level education online.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can search a
database of MOOCs at the <a href="https://www.class-central.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class Central</a>
website.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I recommend the edX course:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x-engineering-3811#.VCIWQCtdWJk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CS169.1x Engineering Software as a Service</a>
</li></ul>
<p>It is a nine week class, it is free, and it is taught four times a year.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is based on a software engineering class taught at the University of
California, Berkeley.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The professors have written their own textbook to
accompany the class, <a href="http://www.saasbook.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engineering Software as a Service: An Agile
Approach Using Cloud Computing</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The class is
very worthwhile, if you have the time and it fits your schedule.</p>

<div id="uid260" data-tralics-id="uid260" class="subsection" data-number="15.2.4"><h3><a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/books/learn-rails-1#uid260" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">15.2.4 </span>Videos</a></h3>
<p>Online code camps and MOOCs provide supervised learning, combining
videos with access to coaches or instructors.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you want self-paced
study, without access to a coach, you’ll find hundreds of videos online,
varying greatly in quality.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s one big problem with videos: The
ones that are easiest to find are often outdated.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is very difficult
for producers to revise videos and, as you know, Rails changes often.</p>
<p>Michael Hartl, author of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>,
a book I recommend, offers
screencasts to accompany the book.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The cost is $149 USD.</p>
<p><a href="https://gorails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Rails</a> offers dozens of intermediate and
advanced screencasts.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Chris Oliver started producing the videos in
mid-2014, so they are newer than most Rails screencasts you’ll find on
the web.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These are task-focused videos, good for supplementing a book or
course.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some are free, some are available with a $19 USD subscription.</p>
<p><a href="http://railscasts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RailsCasts</a> seems to always be recommended by
Rails developers, and these screencasts were once among the best ways to
learn about Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> RailsCasts creator Ryan Bates left the community in
mid-2013 and, unfortunately, many of the screencasts are no longer
current or relevant.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Still, they are worth a look.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lynda.com</a> offers a <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-4-Essential-Training/139989-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails 4 Essential

12 hour video series at a cost of $25 USD for a monthly subscription.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It covers Rails 4.0 and is an adequate introduction at a very low cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://upcase.com/subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thoughtbot Upcase</a>, formerly known as
ThoughtBot Learn Prime, is a program from the respected ThoughtBot

course, and the company offers a dozen additional courses that cover
both Ruby and Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The courses combine instructional videos with
in-browser coding exercises at a cost of $29 USD per month.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The quality
is high, the videos are current, and the company tries to make the
topics entertaining.</p>
<p><a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pragmatic Studio</a>, publishers of many
high-quality Rails books, offers a series of 26 videos for $179 USD.
The course is a solid introduction to Rails.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.baserails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baserails.com</a> is a video series, available
with a $25 USD monthly subscription, that shows you how to build an
application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s good if you want practice before building something on
your own.</p>
<p><a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Month Rails</a> is an 8
hour video series aimed at beginners.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s priced at $99 (though you
can find discount codes if you search).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’ve read Book Two, you
should skip One Month Rails and focus on intermediate-level books and
courses.</p>
<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:ruby" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treehouse</a> is a
subscription site ($25 USD per month) with a big budget and many course

<p>At the beginning of this chapter, I recommended <a href="http://easyactiverecord.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Active Record for Rails Developers</a> by Jason Gilmore because it is focused on databases and Rails, the next thing you need to study.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Other books deserve mention.</p>
<p>One book stands out among all:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl (free online)
</li></ul>
<p>More Rails developers read, and recommend, Michael Hartl’s book than any other.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For you, after reading this book and <a href="http://easyactiverecord.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Active Record for Rails Developers</a>, Michael Hartl’s book will be a review of what you’ve learned.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I hope you will breeze through it, given the fundamental concepts you’ve already learned.</p>
<p>Two other books on Rails are notable:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pragprog.com/book/rails5/agile-web-development-with-rails-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agile Web Development with Rails 5</a> by Sam Ruby
</li>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/tr5w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rails 5 Way</a> by Obie Fernandez
</li></ul>
<p>Both are dense, comprehensive, and authoritative.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In my opinion,
you should start building Rails applications before digging into these
books.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As you begin building applications, dip into any of these books for further
explanation and insight.</p>
<p>I recommend the book by Justin Weiss, <a href="https://www.justinweiss.com/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practicing
Rails: Learn Rails Without Being
Overwhelmed</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The book provides useful technical
tips and tricks, such as techniques for debugging, but the focus of the
book is overcoming challenges that new developers commonly face.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll
find advice about keeping up with the Rails community and managing time
and motivation when learning Rails, as well as overcoming “the tutorial
gap” to begin building your own applications.</p>
<p>Several other books should be on your reading list to improve your
skill:</p>
<p><a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebuilding Rails</a> by Noah Gibbs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you
like to discover how things work, you’ll gain a deep insight into Rails
from Noah Gibbs’s book, as he shows you how to build a framework like
Rails from scratch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sandimetz.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a>
by Sandi Metz.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A must-read that
teaches the techniques of master programmers.</p>
<p>In addition to the books listed here, I recommended several books to
help you learn the Ruby programming language at the the end of the
chapter, “Just Enough Ruby.”</p>
